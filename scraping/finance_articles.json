Analysts and investors use it to determine the relative value of a company's shares in side-by-side comparisons. What Is the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio? The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio measures a company's share price relative to its earnings per share (EPS). Often called the price or earnings multiple, the P/E ratio helps assess the relative value of a company's stock. It's handy for comparing a company's valuation against its historical performance, against other firms within its industry, or the overall market. Key Takeaways The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is the proportion of a company's share price to its earnings per share. A high P/E ratio could mean that a company's stock is overvalued or that investors expect high growth rates. Companies with no earnings or are losing money don't have a P/E ratio because there's nothing to put in the denominator. The two most used P/E ratios are forward and trailing P/E. P/E ratios are most valuable when comparing similar companies in the same industry or for a single company over time. Investopedia / Xiaojie Liu Understanding the P/E Ratio The P/E ratio is one of the most widely used by investors and analysts reviewing a stock's relative valuation. It helps to determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. A company's P/E can also be benchmarked against other stocks in the same industry or against the broader market, such as the S&P 500 Index. Analysts interested in long-term valuation trends can look at the P/E 10 or P/E 30 measures, which average the past 10 or 30 years of earnings. These measures are often used when trying to gauge the overall value of a stock index, such as the S&P 500, because these longer-term metrics can show overall changes through several business cycles . The P/E ratio of the S&P 500 going back to 1927 has had a low of roughly 6 in mid-1949 and been as high as 122 in mid-2009, right after the financial crisis. As of April 2024, the S&P 500's P/E ratio was 26.26. P/E Ratio Formula and Calculation The formula and calculation are as follows: P/E Ratio = Market value per share Earnings per share \\text{P/E Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Market value per share}}{\\text{Earnings per share}} P/E Ratio = Earnings per share Market value per share ​ To determine the P/E value , divide the stock price by the EPS. The stock price (P) can be found simply by searching a stock’s ticker on a reputable financial website. Although this concrete value reflects what investors currently pay for the stock, the EPS is related to earnings reported at different times. EPS is generally given in two ways. Trailing 12 months (TTM) represents the company's performance over the past 12 months. Another is found in earnings releases, which often provide EPS guidance. This is the company's advice on what it expects in future earnings. These different versions of EPS form the basis of trailing and forward P/E, respectively. When to Review the P/E Ratio Analysts and investors review a company's P/E ratio to determine if the share price accurately represents the projected earnings per share. Forward Price-to-Earnings The most commonly used P/E ratios are the forward P/E and the trailing P/E. A third and less typical variation uses the sum of the last two actual quarters and the estimates of the following two quarters. The forward (or leading) P/E uses future earnings guidance rather than trailing figures. Sometimes called \"estimated price to earnings,\" this forward-looking indicator helps compare current earnings to future earnings and can clarify what earnings will look like without changes and other accounting adjustments. However, there are problems with the forward P/E metric—namely, companies could underestimate earnings to beat the estimated P/E when the next quarter's earnings arrive. Furthermore, external analysts may also provide estimates that diverge from the company estimates, creating confusion. Trailing Price-to-Earnings The trailing P/E relies on past performance by dividing the current share price by the total EPS for the previous 12 months. It's the most popular P/E metric because it's thought to be objective—assuming the company reported earnings accurately. But the trailing P/E also has its share of shortcomings, including that a company’s past performance doesn’t necessarily determine future earnings. Investors often base their purchases on potential earnings, not historical performance. Using the trailing P/E ratio can be a problem because it relies on a fixed earnings per share (EPS) figure, while stock prices are constantly changing. This means that if something significant affects a company's stock price, either positively or negatively, the trailing P/E ratio won't accurately reflect it. In essence, it might not provide an up-to-date picture of the company's valuation or potential. The trailing P/E ratio will change as the price of a company’s stock moves because earnings are released only each quarter, while stocks trade whenever the market is open. As a result, some investors prefer the forward P/E. If the forward P/E ratio is lower than the trailing P/E ratio, analysts are expecting earnings to increase; if the forward P/E is higher than the current P/E ratio, analysts expect them to decline. Valuation From P/E In addition to indicating whether a company’s stock price is overvalued or undervalued, the P/E ratio can reveal how a stock’s value compares with its industry or a benchmark like the S&P 500. The P/E ratio indicates the dollar amount an investor can expect to invest in a company to receive $1 of that company’s earnings. Hence, it’s sometimes called the price multiple because it shows how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of earnings. If a company trades at a P/E multiple of 20x, investors are paying $20 for $1 of current earnings. The P/E ratio also helps investors determine a stock’s market value compared with the company’s earnings. That is, the P/E ratio shows what the market is willing to pay today for a stock based on its past or future earnings. A high P/E ratio could signal that a stock’s price is high relative to earnings and is overvalued. Conversely, a low P/E could indicate that the stock price is low relative to earnings. Examples of the P/E Ratio Let's clarify this with an example, looking at FedEx Corporation ( FDX ). We can calculate the P/E ratio for FDX as of Feb. 9, 2024, when the company's stock price closed at $242.62. The company's earnings per share (EPS) for the trailing 12 months was $16.85. Therefore, FDX's P/E ratio was as follows: $242.62 / $16.85 = 14.40 Comparing Companies Using P/E Let's now look at two energy companies to see their relative values. Hess Corporation ( HES ) had the following data at the close of Feb. 9, 2024. We'll use the diluted EPS to account for what would occur should all convertible securities be exercised: Stock price: $142.07 Diluted 12 months trailing EPS: $4.49 P/E: 31.64 ($142.07 / $4.49) HES thus traded at about 31 times trailing earnings. However, the P/E of 31 isn't helpful unless you have something to compare it with, like the stock's industry group, a benchmark index, or HES's historical P/E range. HES's P/E ratio was higher than the S&P 500, which, as of Feb. 9, 2024, was about 22 times 12-month trailing earnings. To compare HES's P/E ratio to a peer, let's look at Marathon Petroleum Corporation ( MPC ): Stock price: $169.97 Diluted 12 months trailing EPS: $23.64 P/E: 7.19 When you compare HES's P/E of 31 to MPC's of 7, HES's stock could appear substantially overvalued relative to the S&P 500 and MPC. Alternatively, HES's higher P/E might mean that investors expect much higher earnings growth in the future than MPC. However, no ratio can tell you everything you need about a stock. Before investing, it's wise to use various financial tools to determine whether a stock is fairly valued. Investor Expectations In general, a high P/E suggests that investors expect higher earnings growth than those with a lower P/E. A low P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued or that a firm is doing exceptionally well relative to its past performance. When a company has no earnings or is posting losses, the P/E is expressed as N/A . Though it's possible to calculate a negative P/E, it's not common. The P/E ratio can also standardize the value of $1 of earnings throughout the stock market. In theory, by taking the median of P/E ratios over a period of several years, one could formulate something of a standardized P/E ratio, which could then be seen as a benchmark and used to indicate whether a stock is worth buying. N/A Meaning A P/E ratio of N/A means the ratio is unavailable for that company's stock. A company can have a P/E ratio of N/A if it's newly listed on the stock exchange and has not yet reported earnings, such as with an initial public offering. It could also mean a company has zero or negative earnings. P/E vs. Earnings Yield The inverse of the P/E ratio is the earnings yield (which can be thought of as the earnings/price ratio). The earnings yield is the EPS divided by the stock price, expressed as a percentage. If Stock A is trading at $10, and its EPS for the past year is 50 cents (TTM), it has a P/E of 20 (i.e., $10 / 50 cents) and an earnings yield of 5% (50 cents / $10). If Stock B is trading at $20 and its EPS (TTM) is $2, it has a P/E of 10 (i.e., $20 / $2) and an earnings yield of 10% ($2 / $20). The earnings yield is not as widely used as the P/E ratio. Earnings yields are useful if you're concerned about the rate of return on investment. For equity investors who earn periodic investment income, this may be a secondary concern. This is why many investors may prefer value-based measures like the P/E ratio or stocks. The earnings yield is also helpful when a company has zero or negative earnings. Since this is common among high-tech, high-growth, or startup companies, EPS will be negative and listed as an undefined P/E ratio (denoted as N/A). If a company has negative earnings, however, it would have a negative earnings yield, which can be used for comparison. P/E vs. PEG Ratio A P/E ratio, even one calculated using a forward earnings estimate, doesn’t always tell you whether the P/E is appropriate for the company’s expected growth rate. To address this, investors turn to the price/earnings-to-growth ratio , or PEG. The PEG ratio measures the relationship between the price/earnings ratio and earnings growth to give investors a complete picture. Investors use it to see if a stock’s price is overvalued or undervalued by analyzing earnings and the expected growth rate for the company. The PEG ratio is calculated as a company’s trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divided by its earnings growth rate for a given period. Since it’s based on both trailing earnings and future earnings growth, PEG is often viewed as more informative than the P/E ratio. For example, a low P/E ratio could suggest a stock is undervalued and worth buying. However, including the company’s growth rate to get its PEG ratio might tell a different story. PEG ratios can be termed “trailing” if using historical growth rates or “forward” if using projected growth rates. Although earnings growth rates can vary among different sectors, a stock with a PEG of less than one is typically considered undervalued because its price is low relative to its expected earnings growth. A PEG greater than one might be considered overvalued because it suggests the stock price is too high relative to the company’s expected earnings growth. Absolute vs. Relative P/E Analysts also distinguish between absolute P/E and relative P/E ratios in their analyses. Absolute P/E The numerator of this ratio is usually the current stock price, and the denominator may be the trailing EPS (TTM), the estimated EPS for the next 12 months (forward P/E), or a mix of the trailing EPS of the last two quarters and the forward P/E for the next two quarters. When distinguishing absolute P/E from relative P/E, remember that absolute P/E represents the P/E of the current period. For example, if the stock price today is $100 and the TTM earnings are $2 per share, the P/E is 50 = ($100 / $2). Relative P/E The relative P/E compares the absolute P/E to a benchmark or a range of past P/Es over a relevant period, such as the past 10 years. The relative P/E shows what portion or percentage of the past P/Es that the current P/E has reached. The relative P/E usually compares the current P/E value with the highest value of the range. Investors might also compare the current P/E to the bottom side of the range, measuring how close the current P/E is to the historic low. The relative P/E will have a value below 100% if the current P/E is lower than the past value (whether the past is high or low). If the relative P/E measure is 100% or more, this tells investors that the current P/E has reached or surpassed the past value. Limitations of Using the P/E Ratio Like any other fundamental metric, the price-to-earnings ratio comes with a few limitations that are important to understand. Companies that aren't profitable and have no earnings—or negative earnings per share—pose a challenge for calculating P/E. Views among analysts vary about how to deal with this. Some say there is a negative P/E, others assign a P/E of 0, while most just say the P/E doesn't exist (N/A) until a company becomes profitable. A main limitation of using P/E ratios is for comparing the P/E ratios of companies from varied sectors. Companies' valuation and growth rates often vary wildly between industries because of how and when the firms earn their money. As such, one should only use P/E as a comparative tool when considering companies in the same sector because this is the only kind that will provide worthwhile results. For example, comparing the P/E ratios of a retail company and the P/E of an oil and gas drilling company could suggest one is the superior investment, but that's not a cogent conclusion. An individual company’s high P/E ratio, for example, would be less cause for concern when the entire sector has high P/E ratios . Other P/E Considerations Because a company’s debt can affect both share price and earnings, leverage can skew P/E ratios as well. For example, suppose two similar companies differ in the debt they hold. The firm with more debt will likely have a lower P/E value than the one with less debt. However, if the business is solid, the one with more debt could have higher earnings because of the risks it has taken. Another critical limitation of price-to-earnings ratios lies within the formula for calculating P/E. P/E ratios rely on accurately presenting the market value of shares and earnings per share estimates. The market determines the prices of shares available in many places. However, the source of earnings information is the company itself. Thus, it’s possible it could be manipulated, so analysts and investors have to trust the company’s officers to provide genuine information. The stock will be considered riskier and less valuable if that trust is broken. To reduce these risks, the P/E ratio is only one measurement analyst's review. If a company were to manipulate its results intentionally, it would be challenging to ensure all the metrics were aligned in how they were changed. That’s why the P/E ratio continues to be a central data point when analyzing public companies, though by no means is it the only one. Alternatives to P/E Ratios While the P/E ratio is a commonly used metric, you can also use several other alternatives. One such alternative is the price-to-book (P/B) ratio. This ratio compares a company's market value to its book value. The book value represents the company's net asset value according to its balance sheet. The P/B ratio is particularly useful for industries with substantial tangible assets, and a lower P/B ratio may indicate that the stock is undervalued. Another alternative is the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio which compares a company's stock price to its revenues. This ratio is useful for evaluating companies that may not be profitable yet or are in industries with volatile earnings. The P/S ratio gives you insight into how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of sales, making it particularly relevant for start-ups or tech companies with high growth potential but inconsistent earnings. The last alternative to consider is the enterprise value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio. It assesses a company's valuation relative to its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The EV/EBITDA ratio is helpful because it accounts for the company's debt and cash levels, providing a more holistic view of its valuation compared to the P/E ratio. Investors often use the EV/EBITDA ratio to evaluate companies in capital-intensive industries such as telecommunications or utilities. What Is a Good Price-to-Earnings Ratio? The answer depends on the industry. Some industries tend to have higher average price-to-earnings ratios. For example, in February 2024, the Communications Services Select Sector Index had a P/E of 17.60, while it was 29.72 for the Technology Select Sector Index. To get a general idea of whether a particular P/E ratio is high or low, compare it to the average P/E of others in its sector, then other sectors and the market. Is It Better to Have a Higher or Lower P/E Ratio? Many investors say buying shares in companies with a lower P/E ratio is better because you are paying less for every dollar of earnings. A lower P/E ratio is like a lower price tag, making it attractive to investors looking for a bargain. In practice, however, there could be reasons behind a company’s particular P/E ratio. For instance, if a company has a low P/E ratio because its business model is declining, the bargain is an illusion. What Does a P/E Ratio of 15 Mean? A P/E ratio of 15 means that the company’s current market value equals 15 times its annual earnings. Put literally, if you were to hypothetically buy 100% of the company’s shares, it would take 15 years for you to earn back your initial investment through the company’s ongoing profits. However, that 15-year estimate would change if the company grows or its earnings fluctuate. What Is the Difference Between Forward P/E and Trailing P/E? The trailing P/E ratio uses earnings per share from the past 12 months, reflecting historical performance. In contrast, the forward P/E ratio uses projected earnings for the next 12 months, incorporating future expectations. Forward P/E is often used to gauge investor sentiment about the company's growth prospects while trailing P/E provides a snapshot based on actual past performance. What Are the Limitations of the P/E Ratio? The P/E ratio has several limitations. It doesn't account for future earnings growth, can be influenced by accounting practices, and may not be comparable across different industries. It also doesn't consider other financial aspects such as debt levels, cash flow, or the quality of earnings. The Bottom Line The P/E ratio is one of many fundamental financial metrics for evaluating a company . It's calculated by dividing the current market price of a stock by its earnings per share. It indicates investor expectations, helping to determine if a stock is overvalued or undervalued relative to its earnings. The P/E ratio helps compare companies within the same industry, like an insurance company to an insurance company or telecom to telecom. It offers insights into market sentiment and investment prospects. However, it should be used with other financial measures since it doesn't account for future growth prospects, debt levels, or industry-specific factors.",
    "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trailingpe.asp": "Definition Trailing price-to-earnings is a relative valuation multiple that is calculated by taking the current stock price and dividing it by the trailing earnings-per-share for the past 12 months. What Is Trailing Price-To-Earnings? Trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) is a relative valuation multiple that is based on the last 12 months of actual earnings. It is calculated by taking the current stock price and dividing it by the trailing earnings per share (EPS) for the past 12 months. Trailing P/E can be contrasted with the forward P/E , which instead uses projected future earnings to calculate the price-to-earnings ratio. Key Takeaways The trailing price-to-earnings ratio looks at a company's share price in the market relative to its past year's earnings per share. Trailing P/E is considered a useful indicator to standardize and compare relative share price between time periods and among companies. Trailing P/E, though widespread in use, is limited in that past earnings may not accurately reflect the current or future earnings situation of the company. Understanding Trailing Price-To-Earnings (P/E) The price-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio , is calculated by dividing a company's stock price by its earnings from the most recent fiscal year . When people refer to the P/E ratio generically, they are typically referring to the trailing P/E. It is calculated by dividing the current market value, or share price, by the earnings per share (EPS) over the previous 12 months. The earnings for the most recent fiscal year can be found on the income statement in the annual report. At the bottom of the income statement is a total EPS for the firm's entire fiscal year. Divide the company's current stock price by this number to get the trailing P/E ratio. Trailing P/E Ratio = Current Share Price / Trailing 12-Month EPS This measure is considered the reliable since it is calculated based on actual performance rather than expected future performance. However, a company's past earnings are not necessarily always a good predictor of future earnings, and so caution is warranted Why Do Analysts Use P/E? Analysts like the P/E ratio because it creates an apples-to-apples evaluation of relative earnings. The P/E ratio can thus be used to look for relative bargains in the market or to determine when a stock is too expensive compared to others. Some companies deserve a higher P/E multiple because they have deeper economic moats , but some companies with high share price relative to earnings are simply overpriced. Likewise, some firms deserve a lower P/E because they represent a great bargain, while other company's are justified in a low P/E due to financial weakness. Trailing P/E helps analysts match time periods for a more accurate and up-to-date measure of relative value . A disadvantage of the P/E ratio is that stock prices are constantly moving, while earnings remain fixed. Analysts attempt to deal with this issue by using the trailing price-to-earnings ratio, which uses earnings from the most recent four quarters rather than earnings from the end of the last fiscal year. Example of Trailing Price-To-Earnings For example, a company with a stock price of $50 and 12 month trailing EPS of $2, thus has a trailing P/E ratio of 25x (read 25 times). This means that the company's stock is trading at 25x its trailing 12 month earnings. Using the same example, if the company's stock price falls to $40 midway through the year, the new P/E ratio is 20x, which means the stock's price is now trading at only 20x its earnings. Earnings have not changed, but the stock's price has dropped. Earnings for the last two quarters may have also dropped. In this case, analysts can substitute the first two-quarters of the fiscal year calculation with the most recent two quarters for a trailing P/E ratio. If earnings in the first half of the year, represented by the most recent two quarters, are trending lower, the P/E ratio will be higher than 20x. This tells analysts that the stock may actually be overvalued at the current price given its declining level of earnings. Trailing vs. Forward P/E The trailing P/E ratio differs from the forward P/E, which uses earnings estimates or forecasts for the next four quarters or next projected 12 months of earnings. As a result, forward P/E can sometimes be more relevant to investors when evaluating a company. Nonetheless, as forward P/E relies on estimated future earnings, it is prone to miscalculation and/or the bias of analysts. Companies may also underestimate or mis-state earnings in order to beat consensus estimate P/E in the next quarterly earnings report. Both ratios are useful during acquisitions. The trailing P/E ratio is an indicator of past performance of the company being acquired. Forward P/E represents the company's guidance for the future. Typically valuations of the acquired company are based on the latter ratio. However, the buyer can use an earnout provision to lower the acquisition price, with the option of making an additional payout if the targeted earnings are achieved.",
    "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardpe.asp": "What Is Forward Price-to-Earnings (Forward P/E)? Forward price-to-earnings (forward P/E) is a version of the ratio of price-to-earnings (P/E) that uses forecasted earnings to calculate the ratio. Although these earnings estimates aren't as reliable as current or historical earnings data, forward P/E analysis may still offer valuable insights to investors. P/E ratios vary significantly by sector due to differences in growth rates, risk profiles, and capital structures specific to each industry. For instance, regional banks, which tend to have stable earnings, typically have a forward P/E of around 16. In contrast, the healthcare information and technology sector, driven by rapid innovation and higher growth expectations, has a much higher forward P/E of 133. Forward P/E guides capital market analysts on what to expect in future earning cycles. These expectations influence stock prices, which will adjust based on the actual earnings compared to the forecasts. Key Takeaways: Forward P/E is a version of the ratio of price-to-earnings that uses forecasted earnings for the P/E calculation. Because forward P/E uses estimated earnings per share (EPS), it may produce incorrect or biased results if actual earnings are different. Analysts often combine forward and trailing P/E estimates, along with other key financial metrics, to make a better judgment. Understanding Forward Price-to-Earnings (Forward P/E) The forecasted earnings in the formula below are typically projected for the following 12 months or the next full-year fiscal (FY) period. The forward P/E can be contrasted with the trailing P/E ratio . Forward P / E = Current Share Price Estimated Future Earnings per Share \\text{Forward } P/E = \\frac{\\text{Current Share Price}}{\\text{Estimated Future Earnings per Share}} Forward P / E = Estimated Future Earnings per Share Current Share Price ​ For example, assume a company has a current share price of $50 and this year’s earnings per share (EPS) are $5. Analysts estimate that the company's earnings will grow by 10% over the next fiscal year. The company has a current P/E ratio of: The forward P/E, on the other hand, would be $50 / (5 x 1.10) = 9.1x. Note that the forward P/E is smaller than the current P/E since the forward P/E accounts for future earnings growth relative to today's share price. To illustrate this with a real example, Apple's (AAPL) stock currently has a forward P/E of 34.57. With the stock priced at $233, analysts expect Apple’s future annual earnings per share to be $6.74. This demonstrates how forward P/E ratios provide insight into expected future performance based on current market prices. What Does Forward Price-to-Earnings Reveal? Analysts like to consider the P/E ratio as a price tag on earnings, used to calculate a company's relative value based on its earnings. In theory, $1 of earnings should be worth the same across different companies, but this is rarely the case in practice. For instance, if Company A trades at $5 per share and Company B at $10 per share, the market values Company B's earnings more. This difference can be interpreted in various ways. For example, it might indicate that Company B's earnings are overvalued or that Company B's superior management and business model warrant a higher valuation. The trailing P/E ratio compares today's price against earnings for the past 12 months or the last fiscal year , reflecting historical data. In contrast, the forward P/E ratio uses earnings estimates to project the company's future value based on expected earnings. For example, if the current price of Company B is $10, and earnings are expected to double to $2 next year, the forward P/E ratio would be 5x, indicating the company is valued at half its current P/E ratio. A lower forward P/E ratio compared to the current P/E suggests analysts expect earnings to increase. Conversely, a higher forward P/E ratio indicates expectations of declining earnings. Forward P/E vs. Trailing P/E Forward P/E uses projected earnings per share while trailing P/E relies on past performance by dividing the current share price by the total EPS earnings over the past 12 months. Trailing P/E is the most popular metric because it's objective is to assume that the company has reported earnings accurately. Some investors prefer trailing P/E because they don't trust earnings estimates made by others. However, trailing P/E has shortcomings, namely, that past performance doesn't guarantee future results. Investors may be better off focusing on future earnings power , rather than past earnings. Another issue with trailing P/E is that the EPS number remains constant while stock prices fluctuate. If a significant event causes the stock price to rise or fall dramatically, the trailing P/E may not accurately reflect these changes. Limitations of Forward P/E Since forward P/E relies on estimated future earnings, it can be subject to miscalculation and analyst bias. Companies might underestimate earnings to beat future consensus estimates or overstate them and adjust later. Analysts' estimates can also differ from company estimates, adding to potential confusion. That's one key reason forward P/E ratios are often cited as indicators of a stock's value, but studies show that trailing P/E ratios are more reliable for predicting future performance. If you use forward P/E as the central basis of your investment thesis , research the companies thoroughly. Updates to a company's guidance can significantly affect the forward P/E, possibly altering your investment perspective. It’s wise to use both forward and trailing P/E ratios to form a more reliable assessment. How to Calculate Forward P/E in Excel Using Microsoft Excel, you can calculate a company's forward P/E for the next fiscal year. The forward P/E formula is the company's market price per share divided by its expected earnings per share. To set up your Excel sheet: Increase the widths of columns A, B, and C to 30 by right-clicking on each column, selecting \"Column Width,\" and entering 30. In cell B1, enter the name of the first company; in cell C1, enter the name of the second company. In cell A2, enter \"Market price per share,\" then input the market prices for the companies in cells B2 and C2. In cell A3, enter \"Forward earnings per share,\" then input the expected EPS for the companies in cells B3 and C3. In cell A4, enter \"Forward price to earnings ratio.\" For example, assume that Company ABC is currently trading at $50 and has an expected EPS of $2.60: Enter \"Company ABC\" into cell B1. Enter \"=50\" into cell B2 and \"=2.6\" into cell B3. Then, enter \"=B2/B3\" into cell B4. The resulting forward P/E ratio for company ABC is 19.23. On the other hand, company DEF currently has a market value per share of $30 and has an expected EPS of $1.80: Enter \"Company DEF\" into cell C1. Next, enter \"=30\" into cell C2 and \"=1.80\" into cell C3. Then, enter \"=C2/C3\" into cell C4, resulting in a forward P/E ratio of 16.67. Why Might a Forward P/E Ratio Be Higher Than P/E? If the forward P/E ratio is higher than the current P/E ratio, it indicates that analysts expect the company's earnings to decrease in the future. However, these estimates aren't always accurate and can be subject to revisions. Why Do Forward P/E Ratios Vary By Sector? Forward P/E ratios tend to vary by sector due to differences in industry growth rates, risk profiles, and capital structures. The technology sector, for example, often has higher forward P/E ratios because investors anticipate rapid growth and significant future earnings in these industries. Sectors such as utilities often have lower forward P/E ratios since they're viewed as having slower growth potential. What is Considered a Good Forward P/E? There is no good forward P/E ratio as it varies by industry. However, a lower forward P/E ratio may indicate a stock is undervalued relative to its future earnings potential. The Bottom Line The forward P/E ratio can be a valuable tool for investors, providing insight into a company's future earnings potential relative to its current stock price. But while it can help predict future performance, it's important to also recognize its limitations, including relying on analysts' estimates, which can be inaccurate. Investors should use forward P/E alongside other metrics, such as trailing P/E, PEG ratio , and book value, to get a comprehensive view. A balanced approach to stock analysis and valuation is your best bet, and consulting an investment professional can provide additional guidance.",
    "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegratio.asp": "What Is the Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) Ratio? The price/earnings to growth ratio (PEG ratio) is a stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divided by the growth rate of its earnings for a specified time period. The PEG ratio is used to determine a stock's value while also factoring in the company's expected earnings growth. It provides a more complete picture than the standard P/E ratio. Key Takeaways The PEG ratio enhances the P/E ratio by adding expected earnings growth into the calculation. The PEG ratio is considered to be an indicator of a stock's true value. Similar to the P/E ratio, a lower PEG may indicate that a stock is undervalued. The PEG for a given company may differ significantly from one reported source to another. Differences will depend on which growth estimate is used in the calculation, such as one-year or three-year projected growth. A PEG lower than 1.0 is best, suggesting that a company is relatively undervalued. Investopedia / Paige McLaughlin How to Calculate the PEG Ratio PEG Ratio = Price/EPS EPS Growth where: EPS = The earnings per share \\begin{aligned} &\\text{PEG Ratio}=\\frac{\\text{Price/EPS}}{\\text{EPS Growth}}\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &\\text{EPS = The earnings per share}\\\\ \\end{aligned} ​ PEG Ratio = EPS Growth Price/EPS ​ where: EPS = The earnings per share ​ To calculate the PEG ratio, you need to look up or calculate the P/E ratio of the company in question. The P/E ratio is calculated as the price per share of the company divided by the earnings per share (EPS), or price per share / EPS. Once the P/E is calculated, find the expected growth rate for the stock in question, using analyst estimates available on financial websites that follow the stock . Plug the figures into the equation, and solve for the PEG ratio number. Accuracy As with any ratio, the accuracy of the PEG ratio depends on the inputs used. When considering a company's PEG ratio from a published source, it's important to find out which growth rate was used in the calculation. Using historical growth rates, for example, may provide an inaccurate PEG ratio if future growth rates are expected to deviate from a company's historical growth. The ratio can be calculated using one-year, three-year, or five-year expected growth rates, for example. Fast Fact To distinguish between calculation methods using future growth and historical growth, the terms \"forward PEG\" and \"trailing PEG\" are sometimes used. What Does the PEG Ratio Tell You? While a low P/E ratio may make a stock look like a good buy , factoring in the company's growth rate to get the stock's PEG ratio may tell a different story. The lower the PEG ratio, the more the stock may be undervalued given its future earnings expectations. Adding a company's expected growth into the ratio helps to adjust the result for companies that may have a high growth rate and a high P/E ratio. The degree to which a PEG ratio result indicates an over or underpriced stock varies by industry and by company type. As a broad rule of thumb, some investors feel that a PEG ratio below one is desirable. According to well-known investor Peter Lynch, a company's P/E and expected growth should be equal, which denotes a fairly valued company and supports a PEG ratio of 1.0. When a company's PEG exceeds 1.0, it's considered overvalued while a stock with a PEG of less than 1.0 is considered undervalued. Example of How to Use the PEG Ratio The PEG ratio provides useful information to compare companies and see which stock might be the better choice for an investor's needs, as follows. Assume the following data for two hypothetical companies, Company A and Company B. Company A: Price per share = $46 EPS this year = $2.09 EPS last year = $1.74 Company B Price per share = $80 EPS this year = $2.67 EPS last year = $1.78 Given this information, the following data can be calculated for each company: Company A P/E ratio = $46 / $2.09 = 22 Earnings growth rate = ($2.09 / $1.74) - 1 = 20% PEG ratio = 22 / 20 = 1.1 Company B P/E ratio = $80 / $2.67 = 30 Earnings growth rate = ($2.67 / $1.78) - 1 = 50% PEG ratio = 30 / 50 = 0.6 Many investors may look at Company A and find it more attractive since it has a lower P/E ratio among the two companies. But compared to Company B, it doesn't have a high enough growth rate to justify its current P/E. Company B is trading at a discount to its growth rate and investors purchasing it are paying less per unit of earnings growth. Based on its lower PEG, Company B may be the better buy. What Is Considered to Be a Good PEG Ratio? In general, a good PEG ratio has a value lower than 1.0. PEG ratios greater than 1.0 are generally considered unfavorable, suggesting a stock is overvalued. Meanwhile, PEG ratios lower than 1.0 are considered better, indicating that a stock is relatively undervalued. What Is Better: A Higher or Lower PEG Ratio? Lower PEG ratios are better, especially ratios under 1.0. What Does a Negative PEG Ratio Indicate? A negative PEG can result from either negative earnings (losses), or a negative estimated growth rate. Either case suggests that a company may be in trouble. The Bottom Line While the P/E ratio is more commonly used by investors, the PEG ratio improves upon the P/E ratio by incorporating earnings growth estimates. This provides a fuller picture of a company's relative value in the market. However, because it relies on earnings estimates, having good estimates is key. A bad forecast or assumption, or naively projecting historical growth rates into the future, can produce unreliable PEG ratios.",
    "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-bookratio.asp": "What Is the Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio? Many investors use the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) to compare a firm's market capitalization to its book value and locate undervalued companies. This ratio is calculated by dividing the company's current stock price per share by its book value per share (BVPS). Key Takeaways The price-to-book (P/B) ratio measures the market's valuation of a company relative to its book value. The market value of equity is typically higher than the book value of a company's stock. The price-to-book ratio is used by value investors to identify potential investments. P/B ratios under 1.0 are typically considered solid investments by value investors. A good P/B ratio is relative to a business and its industry. Investopedia / Theresa Chiechi Formula and Calculation of the Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio The formula for the price-to-book ratio is: P / B R a t i o = M a r k e t P r i c e p e r S h a r e B o o k V a l u e p e r S h a r e P/B ~Ratio = \\dfrac{Market~Price~per~Share}{Book~Value~per~Share} P / B R a t i o = B oo k Va l u e p er S ha re M a r k e t P r i ce p er S ha re ​ Where: Market Price per Share = Current market price of the share Book Value per Share = (Total assets - intangible assets - total liabilities) ÷ number of outstanding shares Market value per share is obtained by looking at the information available on most stock tracking websites. You need to find the company's balance sheet to obtain total assets, total liabilities, and outstanding shares. Most investment websites display this financial report under a \"financials\" tab—some show it on a stock's summary tab. What the Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio Can Tell You The P/B ratio reflects the value that market participants attach to a company's equity relative to the book value of its equity. Many investors use the P/B ratio to find undervalued stocks. By purchasing an undervalued stock , they hope to be rewarded when the market realizes the stock is undervalued and returns its price to where it should be—according to the investor's analysis. Some investors believe that the P/B ratio is a forward-looking metric that reflects a company's future cash flows. However, when you look at the information used to calculate the P/B ratio, the factors used are the price investors are willing to pay currently, the number of shares issued by a company, and values from a balance sheet that reflect data from the past. Thus, the ratio isn't forward-looking and doesn't predict or indicate future cash flows. The P/B ratio also provides a valuable reality check for investors seeking growth at a reasonable price . It is often evaluated with return on equity (ROE), a reliable growth indicator. Large discrepancies between the P/B ratio and ROE often raise a red flag for investors. Fast Fact Overvalued growth stocks frequently show a combination of low ROE and high P/B ratios. Properly valued stocks have ROE and P/B ratios that grow somewhat similarly because stocks that generate higher returns tend to attract investors and increase demand, thus increasing the stock's market price. A high P/B ratio suggests a stock could be overvalued, while a lower P/B ratio could mean the stock is undervalued . As with most ratios, the P/B ratio varies by industry. A company should be compared with similarly structured companies in similar industries; otherwise, the comparison results could be misleading. P/B Ratios and Public Companies It is difficult to pinpoint a specific numeric value of a \"good\" price-to-book (P/B) ratio when determining if a stock is undervalued and therefore, a good investment. It's helpful to identify some general parameters or a range for P/B value, then consider various other factors and valuation measures that more accurately interpret the P/B value and forecast a company's potential for growth. The P/B ratio has been favored by value investors for decades and is widely used by market analysts. Traditionally, any value under 1.0 is considered desirable for value investors, indicating an undervalued stock may have been identified. However, some value investors may often consider stocks with a less stringent P/B value of less than 3.0 as their benchmark. Equity Market Value vs. Book Value Due to accounting procedures, the market value of equity is typically higher than a security's book value, resulting in a P/B ratio above 1.0. During times of low earnings, a company's P/B ratio can dive below a value of 1.0. For example, in most cases, companies must expense research and development costs, reducing book value because this includes the expenses on the balance sheet. However, these R&D outlays can create unique production processes for a company or result in new patents that can bring royalty revenues. While accounting principles favor a conservative approach in capitalizing costs, market participants may raise the stock price because of such R&D efforts, resulting in wide differences between the market and book values of equity. Example of How to Use the Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio Assume that a company has $100 million in assets on the balance sheet, no intangibles, and $75 million in liabilities. Therefore, the book value of that company would be calculated as $25 million ($100 million - $75 million). If there are 10 million shares outstanding , each share would represent $2.50 of book value. Therefore, if the share price is $5, the P/B ratio would be 2.0 (5 / 2.50). This illustrates that the market price is valued at twice its book value, which may or may not indicate overvaluation. This would depend on how P/B ratios compare against other similarly sized companies in the same sector. Important The price-to-book ratio may not be as useful when evaluating the stock of a company with fewer tangible assets on its balance sheets, such as services firms and software development companies. Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio vs. Price-to-Tangible-Book Ratio Closely related to the P/B ratio is the price-to-tangible-book value ratio (PTVB). The latter is a valuation ratio expressing the price of a security compared to its hard (or tangible) book value as reported in the company's balance sheet. The tangible book value number is equal to the company's total book value less than the value of any intangible assets. Intangible assets can be items such as patents, intellectual property, and goodwill. This may be a more useful valuation measure when valuing something like a patent in different ways or if it is difficult to put a value on such an intangible asset in the first place. Limitations of Using the Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio Investors find the P/B ratio useful because the book value of equity provides a relatively stable and intuitive metric they can easily compare to the market price. The P/B ratio can also be used for firms with positive book values and negative earnings since negative earnings render price-to-earnings ratios useless. There are fewer companies with negative book values than companies with negative earnings. However, when accounting standards applied by firms vary, P/B ratios may not be comparable, especially for companies from different countries. Additionally, P/B ratios can be less useful for service and information technology companies with little tangible assets on their balance sheets. Finally, the book value can become negative because of a long series of negative earnings, making the P/B ratio useless for relative valuation. Other potential problems in using the P/B ratio stem from the fact that any number of scenarios, such as recent acquisitions, recent write-offs, or share buybacks can distort the book value figure in the equation. When searching for undervalued stocks, investors should consider multiple valuation measures to complement the P/B ratio. What Does the Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio Compare? The price-to-book ratio is a commonly used financial ratio. It compares a share's market price to its book value, essentially showing the value given by the market for each dollar of the company’s net worth. High-growth companies often show price-to-book ratios well above 1.0, whereas companies facing financial distress occasionally show ratios below 1.0. Another valuable tool is the price-to-sales ratio , which shows the company's revenue generated from equity investments. Why Is the Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio Important? The price-to-book ratio is important because it can help investors understand whether a company's market price seems reasonable compared to its balance sheet. For example, if a company shows a high price-to-book ratio , investors might check to see whether that valuation is justified given other measures, such as its historical return on assets or growth in earnings per share (EPS). What Is a Good Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio? What counts as a “good” price-to-book ratio will depend on the industry in question and the overall state of valuations in the market. An investor assessing the price-to-book ratio of a stock might choose to accept a higher average price-to-book ratio, as compared to an investor looking at the stock of a company in an industry where lower price-to-book ratios are the norm. The Bottom Line The price-to-book (P/B) ratio considers how a stock is priced relative to the book value of its assets. If the P/B is under 1.0, then the market is thought to be underpricing the stock since the accounting value of its assets, if sold, would be greater than the market price of the shares. Therefore, value investors typically look for companies that have low price-to-book ratios, among other metrics. A high P/B ratio can also help investors identify and avoid overvalued companies.",
    "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp": "What Is Earnings Per Share (EPS)? Earnings per share (EPS) is a commonly used measure of a company's profitability. It indicates how much profit each outstanding share of common stock has earned. Generally speaking, the higher a company's EPS, the more profitable it is considered to be. EPS is calculated by dividing a company's net income by the total number of outstanding shares. Key Takeaways Earnings per share (EPS) is a company's net income subtracted by preferred dividends and then divided by the number of common shares it has outstanding. EPS indicates how much money a company makes for each share of its stock and is a widely used metric for estimating corporate value. A higher EPS indicates greater value because investors will pay more for a company's shares if they think the company has higher profits relative to its share price. EPS can be arrived at in several forms, such as excluding extraordinary items or discontinued operations, or on a diluted basis. Like other financial metrics, earnings per share is most valuable when compared against competitor metrics, companies of the same industry, or across a period of time. Investopedia / Alex Dos Diaz Earnings Per Share Equation Earnings per share value is calculated as net income (also known as profits or earnings) divided by available shares. A more refined calculation adjusts the numerator and denominator for shares that could be created through options, convertible debt, or warrants. The numerator of the equation is also more relevant if it is adjusted for continuing operations. Earnings per Share = Net Income − Preferred Dividends End-of-Period Common Shares Outstanding \\text{Earnings per Share}=\\frac{\\text{Net Income }-\\text{ Preferred Dividends}}{\\text{End-of-Period Common Shares Outstanding}} Earnings per Share = End-of-Period Common Shares Outstanding Net Income − Preferred Dividends ​ To calculate a company's EPS, the balance sheet and income statement are used to find the period-end number of common shares, dividends paid on preferred stock (if any), and the net income or earnings. It is more accurate to use a weighted average number of common shares over the reporting term because the number of shares can change over time. Understanding how to find EPS is crucial for evaluating a company's profitability. Any stock dividends or splits that occur must be reflected in the calculation of the weighted average number of shares outstanding . Some data sources simplify the calculation by using the number of shares outstanding at the end of a period. What Does Earnings Per Share (EPS) Indicate? Earnings per share is one of the most important financial metrics employed when determining a firm's profitability on an absolute basis. It is also a major component of calculating the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio , where the E in P/E refers to EPS. By dividing a company's share price by its earnings per share, an investor can see the value of a stock in terms of how much the market is willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. Earnings per share shows an investor how to pick stocks, when used along with other indicators. If you have an interest in stock trading or investing, your next step is to choose a broker that works for your investment style. Comparing EPS in absolute terms may not have much meaning to investors because ordinary shareholders do not have direct access to the earnings. Instead, investors will compare EPS with the share price of the stock to determine the value of earnings and how investors feel about future growth. Example of EPS Say that the calculation of EPS for three companies at the end of the fiscal year was as follows: EPS Example Company Net Income Preferred Dividends Weighted Common Shares Basic EPS Company A $7.6B $0 3.98B $7.6/3.98 = $1.91 Company B $18.23B $1.61B 10.2B $18.23-$1.61/10.2 = $1.63 Company C $1.67B $0 0.541B $1.67/0.541 = $3.09 Basic EPS vs. Diluted EPS The formula in the table above calculates the basic EPS of each of these select companies. Basic EPS does not factor in the dilutive effect of shares that could be issued by the company. When the capital structure of a company includes items such as stock options, warrants, or restricted stock units (RSU), these investments—if exercised—could increase the total number of shares outstanding in the market. To better illustrate the effects of additional securities on per-share earnings, companies also report the diluted EPS , which assumes that all shares that could be outstanding have been issued. For example, say the total number of shares that could be created and issued from Company C's convertible instruments at fiscal year-end was 23 million. If this number is added to its total shares outstanding, its diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be 541 million + 23 million = 564 million shares. The company's diluted EPS is, therefore, $1.67 billion /.564 million = $2.96. Sometimes an adjustment to the numerator is required when calculating a fully diluted EPS. For example, sometimes a lender will provide a loan that allows them to convert the debt into shares under certain conditions. The shares that would be created by the convertible debt should be included in the denominator of the diluted EPS calculation, but if that happened, then the company wouldn’t have paid interest on the debt. In this case, the company or analyst will add the interest paid on convertible debt back into the numerator of the EPS calculation so the result isn’t distorted. EPS Excluding Extraordinary Items Earnings per share can be distorted, both intentionally and unintentionally, by several factors. Analysts use variations of the basic EPS formula to avoid the most common ways that EPS may be inflated. Imagine a company that owns two factories that make cell phone screens. The land on which one of the factories sits has become very valuable as new developments have surrounded it over the past few years. The company’s management team decides to sell the factory and build another one on less valuable land. This transaction creates a windfall profit for the firm. Though this land sale has created real profits for the company and its shareholders, it is considered an “extraordinary item” because there is no reason to believe the company can repeat that transaction in the future. Shareholders might be misled if the windfall is included in the numerator of the EPS equation, so it is excluded. A similar argument could be made if a company had an unusual loss —maybe the factory burned down—which would have temporarily decreased EPS and should be excluded for the same reason. The Formula for EPS Excluding Extraordinary Items Is: EPS = Net Income − Pref.Div. ( + o r − ) Extraordinary Items Weighted Average Common Shares \\text{EPS}=\\frac{\\text{Net Income }-\\text{ Pref.Div. }\\left(+or-\\right)\\text{ Extraordinary Items}}{\\text{Weighted Average Common Shares}} EPS = Weighted Average Common Shares Net Income − Pref.Div. ( + or − ) Extraordinary Items ​ EPS From Continuing Operations A company started the year with 500 stores and had an EPS of $5.00. However, assume that this company closed 100 stores over that period and ended the year with 400 stores. An analyst will want to know what the EPS was for just the 400 stores the company plans to continue with into the next period. In this example, that could increase the EPS because the 100 closed stores were perhaps operating at a loss. By evaluating EPS from continuing operations, an analyst is better able to compare prior performance to current performance. EPS and Capital An important aspect of EPS that is often ignored is the capital that is required to generate the earnings (net income) in the calculation. Two companies could generate the same EPS, but one could do so with fewer net assets; that company would be more efficient at using its capital to generate income and, all other things being equal, would be a \"better\" company in terms of efficiency. A metric that can be used to identify more efficient companies is the return on equity (ROE). EPS and Dividends Although EPS is widely used as a way to track a company’s performance, shareholders do not have direct access to those profits. A portion of the earnings may be distributed as a dividend, but all or a portion of the EPS can be retained by the company. Shareholders, through their representatives on the board of directors , would have to change the portion of EPS that is distributed through dividends to access more of those profits. EPS and Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Making a comparison of the P/E ratio within an industry group can be helpful, though in unexpected ways. Although it seems like a stock that costs more relative to its EPS when compared to peers might be “overvalued,” the opposite tends to be the rule. Regardless of its historical EPS, investors are willing to pay more for a stock if it is expected to grow or outperform its peers. In a bull market , it is normal for the stocks with the highest P/E ratios in a stock index to outperform the average of the other stocks in the index. What Is Rolling EPS Investopedia / Paige McLaughlin Rolling EPS gives an annual earnings per share (EPS) estimate by combining EPS from the past two quarters with estimated EPS from the next two quarters. It may be calculated with the following formula: Rolling EPS = (Net income from the previous two quarters + next two quarters – preferred dividends) / average shares outstanding Earnings per share (EPS), a company's profit divided by the amount of common stock it has in circulation, is one of the most closely observed metrics in investing. Other than serving as an indicator of how much money pulled in after accounting for all expenses was allotted to each share of common stock, it’s also frequently used to determine if a company is reasonably valued. EPS is a key component of the price-to-earnings (P/E) valuation ratio. Divide the share price by EPS and you get a multiple denoting how much we pay for $1 of a company’s profit. In other words, if a company is currently trading at a P/E of 20x that would mean an investor is willing to pay $20 for $1 of current earnings. The share price of a stock may look cheap, fairly valued or expensive, depending on whether you look at historical earnings or estimated future earnings. Earnings forecasts are based on educated guesswork from analysts and are often too rosy, possibly making the valuation look cheap. Historical earnings, on the other hand, are set in stone but may not fairly represent a company's legitimate growth potential. Rolling EPS represents a compromise, giving investors a blend of both. Rolling EPS vs. Trailing EPS Rolling EPS shouldn’t be confused with trailing EPS , which mainly uses the previous four quarters of earnings in its calculation. Sometimes you may hear or spot the term rolling trailing EPS, as well. What this means is that EPS will change as the most recent earnings are added to the calculation and earnings from five quarters ago are dropped to make way for them. What Is a Good Earnings Per Share Ratio? What counts as a good EPS will depend on factors such as the recent performance of the company, the performance of its competitors, and the expectations of the analysts who follow the stock. Sometimes, a company might report growing EPS, but the stock might decline in price if analysts were expecting an even higher number. Likewise, a shrinking EPS figure might nonetheless lead to a price increase if analysts were expecting an even worse result. It is important to always judge EPS in relation to the company’s share price, such as by looking at the company’s P/E or earnings yield . What Is the Difference Between Basic EPS and Diluted EPS? Analysts will sometimes distinguish between basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS consists of the company’s net income divided by its outstanding shares. It is the figure most commonly reported in the financial media and is also the simplest definition of EPS. Diluted EPS, on the other hand, will always be equal to or lower than basic EPS because it includes a more expansive definition of the company’s shares outstanding. Specifically, it incorporates shares that are not currently outstanding but could become outstanding if stock options and other convertible securities were to be exercised. What Is the Difference Between EPS and Adjusted EPS? Adjusted EPS is a type of EPS calculation in which the analyst makes adjustments to the numerator. Typically, this consists of adding or removing components of net income that are deemed to be non-recurring. For instance, if the company’s net income was increased based on a one-time sale of a building, the analyst might deduct the proceeds from that sale, thereby reducing net income. In that scenario, adjusted EPS would be lower than basic EPS. What Are Some Limitations of EPS? When looking at EPS to make an investment or trading decision, be aware of some possible drawbacks. For instance, a company can game its EPS by buying back stock, reducing the number of shares outstanding, and inflating the EPS number given the same level of earnings. Changes to accounting policy for reporting earnings can also change EPS. EPS also does not take into account the price of the share, so it has little to say about whether a company's stock is over or undervalued. How Do You Calculate EPS Using Excel? After collecting the necessary data, input the net income into Excel , preferred dividends, and number of common shares outstanding into three adjacent cells, say B3 through B5. In cell B6, input the formula \"=B3-B4\" to subtract preferred dividends from net income. In cell B7, input the formula \"=B6/B5\" to render the EPS ratio. The Bottom Line Earnings per share (EPS) is an important profitability measure used in relating a stock's price to a company's actual earnings. In general, higher EPS is better but one has to consider the number of shares outstanding, the potential for share dilution, and earnings trends over time. If a company misses or beats analysts' consensus expectations for EPS, its shares can either crash or rally, respectively.",
    "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookvalue.asp": "Definition A company's book value is equal to its assets minus it liabilities, called shareholder equity on a balance sheet. What Is Book Value? Book value is the value of a company's assets after netting out its liabilities. It approximates the total value shareholders would receive if the company were liquidated. The figure that represents book value is the sum of all of the line item amounts in the shareholders' equity section on a company's balance sheet. As noted above, another way to calculate book value is to subtract a business' total liabilities from its total assets. There is also a book value used by accountants to value the assets owned by a company. This differs from the book value for investors because it is only used internally for managerial accounting purposes. Key Takeaways A company's book value is the sum of all the line items in the shareholders' equity section of a balance sheet. It may also be referred to as net worth. Book value is often different from a company's market value. Book value per share (BVPS) and the price-to-book (P/B) ratio are utilized in fundamental analysis. A book value per share that's lower than the market price for the share may indicate that a stock is overvalued. Understanding Book Value Shareholders' equity is a section on a company's balance sheet that displays the shareholders' claim on assets after liabilities have been accounted for. The image below is Amazon's consolidated balance sheet for its 2022 fiscal year. Note the Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity section, and in particular the stockholders' equity details within the red outline. You'll see \"Total Stockholders' Equity\" with a value of $138.2 billion. That is Amazon's book value. This figure is calculated by adding the values of preferred stock, common stock, Treasuries, additional paid-in capital, accumulated other comprehensive income (or loss), and retained earnings. Some companies include in this section unrealized gains or losses, capital surplus or cumulative adjustments, and many other line items, depending on the industry a company operates in and its internal accounting procedures. The following image shows Coca-Cola's \"Equity Attributable to Shareowners\" line at the bottom of its Shareowners' Equity section. In this case, that total of $24.1 billion would be the book value of Coca-Cola. It's one metric that an investor may look for if they're interested in valuating Coca-Cola as a potential investment. Since a company’s book value represents net worth, comparing book value to the market value of the shares can serve as an effective valuation technique when trying to decide whether shares are fairly priced. Book Value Uses Book value has two main uses for investors: It is used in and with other financial ratios to help investors value a company. When compared to the company's market value , book value can indicate whether a stock is underpriced or overpriced. Book value is also included in some financial ratios that can help investors size up a company's financial health. Book Value per Share Book value per share (BVPS) is the per-share book value. Investors can calculate it easily if they have the balance sheet of a company of interest. Investors can compare BVPS to a stock's market price to get an idea of whether that stock is overvalued or undervalued. To get BVPS, you divide the figure for total common shareholders' equity by the total number of outstanding common shares. To obtain the figure for total common shareholders' equity, take the figure for total shareholders' equity and subtract any preferred stock value. If there is no preferred stock, then simply use the figure for total shareholder equity. BVPS = Total Shareholder Equity - Preferred Stock / Total Common Shares Outstanding So, if a company had $21 million in shareholders' equity (and no preferred stock) and two million outstanding common shares, its book value per share would be $10.50: BVPS = $21 million / 2 million BVPS = $10.50 If the market price for a share is higher than the BVPS, then the stock may be seen as overvalued . Important There is a difference between outstanding and issued shares, but some companies might refer to outstanding common shares as issued shares in their reports. Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio Price-to-book (P/B) ratio as a valuation multiple is useful when comparing similar companies within the same industry that follow a uniform accounting method for asset valuation. It can offer a view of how the market values a particular company's stock and whether that value is comparable to the BVPS. The ratio may not serve as a valid valuation basis when comparing companies from different sectors and industries because companies in other industries may record their assets differently. As a result, a high P/B ratio would not necessarily be a premium valuation, and conversely, a low P/B ratio would not automatically be a discount valuation when comparing companies in different industries. The price-to-book ratio is simple to calculate. Just divide the market price per share by the book value per share. P/B Ratio = Market Share Price / Book Value Per Share In the previous example, the BVPS was $10.50. So, if the company's shares had a current market value of $13.17, its price-to-book ratio would be 1.25: P/B Ratio = $13.17 / $10.50 P/B Ratio = 1.25 The figure of 1.25 indicates that the market has priced shares at a premium to the book value of a share. Some may consider this to mean a stock is overvalued. Why Is It Called \"Book Value\"? The term \"book value\" is derived from accounting lingo, where the accounting journal and ledger are known as a company’s books. In fact, another name for accounting is bookkeeping . What Does a Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio of 1.0 Mean? A P/B ratio of 1.0 indicates that the market price of a share of stock is exactly equal to its book value. For value investors, this may signal a good buy since the market price generally carries some premium over book value. Why Is Market Value Often Higher Than Book Value? Book value only uses a company's total shareholder equity. It may not include intangible assets such as patents, intellectual property, brand value, and goodwill. It also may not fully account for workers' skills, human capital, and future profits and growth. Therefore, the market value, which is determined by the market (sellers and buyers) and represents how much investors are willing to pay after accounting for all of these factors, will generally be higher. The Bottom Line Book value is the value of a company's total assets minus its total liabilities . In other words, it is equal to total shareholders' equity. A company's market value will usually be greater than its book value because the market price incorporates investor's thoughts and calculations about intangible assets such as intellectual property, human capital, and future growth prospects. Value investors look for relatively low book values (using metrics like P/B ratio or BVPS) but otherwise strong fundamentals in their quest to find undervalued companies. Correction—Aug. 24, 2023: This article was corrected from a previous version that combined managerial accounting book value with value investing book value, which are two different concepts. As the article now states correctly, investing book value is the line item \"Total Shareholders' Equity\" or an equivalent entry from a company's balance sheet.",
    "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freecashflow.asp": "Definition Free cash flow is the cash a company has generated after deducting cash flows that support and maintain operations and capital assets. What Is Free Cash Flow (FCF)? Free cash flow (FCF) is the amount of cash that a company generates after accounting for spending needed to support its operations and maintain its capital assets . Investors and analysts rely on it as one measurement of a company's profitability. Unlike other measures that are used to analyze cash flow in a company, such as earnings or net income , free cash flow excludes the non-cash expenses of the company's income statement . It also includes spending on equipment and assets, as well as changes in working capital from the balance sheet . Key Takeaways Management and investors use free cash flow as a measure of a company’s financial health. FCF reconciles net income by adjusting for non-cash expenses, changes in working capital, and capital expenditures. Free cash flow can reveal problems in the company's financial fundamentals before they become apparent on its income statement. A positive free cash flow doesn’t always indicate a strong stock trend. Jessica Olah / Investopedia Understanding Free Cash Flow (FCF) Free cash flow is the money that the company has available to repay its creditors or pay dividends and interest to investors. It is money that is on hand and free to use to settle liabilities or obligations. Some investors prefer to use FCF or FCF per share rather than earnings or earnings per share (EPS) as a measure of profitability. This is because earnings and EPS remove non-cash items from the income statement. However, because FCF accounts for investments in property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) it can be lumpy and uneven over time. This can make it less useful for analysis. Investment bankers and analysts who need to evaluate a company’s expected performance with different capital structures will use variations of free cash flow like free cash flow for the firm and free cash flow to equity , which are adjusted for interest payments and borrowings. Calculating Free Cash Flow FCF can be calculated by starting with cash flows from operating activities on the statement of cash flows , because this number will have already adjusted earnings for non-cash expenses and changes in working capital. Sabrina Jiang / Investopedia The income statement and balance sheet can also be used to calculate FCF. Sabrina Jiang / Investopedia Other factors from the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows can be used to arrive at the same calculation. For example, if earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) were not given, an investor could arrive at the correct calculation in the following way. Sabrina Jiang / Investopedia Fast Fact Interest payments are excluded from the generally accepted definition of free cash flow. Benefits of Using Free Cash Flow As a measure of profitability and financial health, free cash flow offers several benefits over other points of analysis. Because FCF accounts for changes in working capital, it can provide important insights into the value of a company, how its operations are being handled, and the health of its fundamental trends. A decrease in accounts payable (outflow) could mean that vendors are requiring faster payment. An increase in accounts receivable (inflow) could mean the company is collecting cash from its customers more quickly. An increase in inventory (outflow) could indicate a building stockpile of unsold products. By including working capital, free cash flow provides an insight that is missing from the income statement. Insights to be Gained in Free Cash Flow Analysis For example, assume that a company made $50,000,000 per year in net income each year for the last decade. This number would appear on the income statement and would lead investors or analysts to assume that the company is in stable financial health. However, a look at the free cash flow might show a different story. If FCF was dropping over the last two years, the numbers might indicate that inventories were rising (outflow), customers were delaying payments (inflow), or vendors were demanding faster payments (outflow). These would be worrisome trends, indicating the potential for future problems. In this situation, FCF has revealed financial weaknesses that wouldn’t be apparent from an examination of the income statement. Looking at FCF is also helpful for potential shareholders or lenders who want to evaluate how likely it is that the company will be able to pay its expected dividends or interest. If the company’s debt payments are deducted from free cash flow to the firm (FCFF), a lender would have a better idea of the quality of cash flows available for paying additional debt. Shareholders can use FCF minus interest payments to predict the stability of future dividend payments. Important Free cash flow is often evaluated on a per-share basis to evaluate the effect of dilution . This is similar to the way that sales and earnings are evaluated. Limitations of Using Free Cash Flow Like any tool for financial analysis, FCF has limitations in what it can reveal. Depreciation One major drawback is that purchases that depreciate over time will be subtracted from FCF the year they are purchased, rather than across multiple years. As a result, free cash flow can seem to indicate a dramatic short-term change in a company’s finances that would not appear in other measures of financial health. Imagine a company has earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $1,000,000 in a given year. This company has had no changes in working capital (equal to current assets minus current liabilities). However, it bought new equipment worth $800,000 at the end of the year. The expense of the new equipment will be spread out over time via depreciation on the income statement, which evens out the impact on earnings. But because FCF accounts for the cash spent on new equipment in the current year, the company will report $200,000 FCF ($1,000,000 EBITDA - $800,000 equipment) on $1,000,000 of EBITDA that year. If we assume that everything else remains the same and there are no further equipment purchases, EBITDA and FCF will be equal again the following year. In this situation, an investor will have to determine why FCF dipped so quickly one year only to return to previous levels, and whether that change is likely to continue. Moreover, understanding the depreciation method being used will garner further insights. For example, net income and FCF will differ based on the amount of depreciation taken per year of the asset’s useful life. If the asset is being depreciated using the book depreciation method, over a useful life of 10 years, then net income will be lower than FCF by $80,000 ($800,000 / 10 years) for each year until the asset is fully depreciated. Alternatively, if the asset is being depreciated using the tax depreciation method, the asset will be fully depreciated in the year it was purchased, resulting in net income equaling FCF in subsequent years. Difficulty Calculating Another limitation is that FCF is not subject to the same financial disclosure requirements as other line items in the financial statements. It takes time to run down the numbers and manually calculate FCF. However, it is worth taking the time because FCF is a good double-check on a company’s reported profitability. Luckily, there is software that makes the calculation easier , notably Microsoft's Excel. Interpreting Free Cash Flow Positive free cash flow doesn’t always correspond with other indicators used in technical analysis. A company with positive free cash flow can have dismal stock trends, and vice versa. Because of this, it is often most helpful to focus analysis on any trends visible over time rather than the absolute values of FCF, earnings, or revenue. Tip If stock prices are a function of the underlying fundamentals , then a positive FCF trend should be correlated with positive stock price trends overall. A common approach is to use the stability of FCF trends as a measure of risk. If the trend of FCF is stable over the last four to five years, then bullish trends in the stock are less likely to be disrupted in the future. However, falling FCF trends, especially FCF trends that are very different compared with earnings and sales trends, indicate a higher likelihood of negative price performance in the future. This approach ignores the absolute value of FCF to focus on the slope of FCF and its relationship to price performance. Example of Free Cash Flow Consider the following example for the hypothetical Company XYZ: 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 TTM Sales/Revenue $100 $105 $120 $126 $128 $130 EPS $1.00 $1.03 $1.15 $1.17 $1.19 $1.20 FCF/Share $0.85 $0.97 $1.07 $1.05 $0.80 $0.56 In this example, there is a strong divergence between the company’s revenue and earnings figures and its free cash flow. Based on these trends, an investor might suspect that Company XYZ is experiencing some kind of financial trouble that hasn’t yet impacted headline numbers such as revenue and earnings per share. In a situation like this, there are several possible causes for the differences between these indicators. Investing in Growth Management for Company XYZ could be investing strongly in property, plant, and equipment to grow the business. An investor can determine whether this is the case by looking at whether capital expenditures (CapEx) were growing from 2019 to 2021. If FCF + CapEx were still upwardly trending, this scenario could be good for the stock’s value. Stockpiling Inventory Low cash flows can be a sign of poor inventory control. Even if Company XYZ has strong sales and revenue, it could still experience diminished cash flows if too many resources are tied up in storing unsold products. A cautious investor could examine these figures and conclude that the company may be struggling with faltering demand or poor cash management. Credit Problems A change in working capital can be caused by inventory fluctuations or by a shift in accounts payable and receivable. If Company XYZ’s sales are struggling, they may choose to extend more generous payment terms to their clients, ultimately leading to a negative adjustment to FCF. Alternatively, a company’s suppliers may be unwilling to extend credit as generously and now require faster payment. That will reduce accounts payable, which is also a negative adjustment to FCF. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, many solar companies were dealing with this kind of credit problem. Sales and income could be inflated by offering more generous terms to clients. However, because this issue was widely known in the industry, suppliers were less willing to extend terms and wanted to be paid by solar companies faster. In this situation, the divergence between the fundamental trends was apparent in FCF analysis but was not immediately obvious by examining the income statement alone. How Is Free Cash Flow Calculated? There are two main approaches to calculating FCF, and choosing between them will likely depend on what financial information about a company is readily available. They should arrive at the same value. The first approach uses cash flow from operating activities as the starting point and then makes adjustments for interest expense, the tax shield on interest expense, and any capital expenditures (CapEx) undertaken that year. The second approach uses earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) as the starting point, then adjusts for income taxes, non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, changes in working capital, and CapEx. What Does Free Cash Flow Indicate? Free cash flow indicates the amount of cash generated each year that is free and clear of all internal or external obligations. This is cash that a company can safely invest or distribute to shareholders. While a healthy FCF metric is generally seen as a positive sign by investors, context is important. A company might show a high FCF because it is postponing important CapEx investments, which could end up causing problems in the future. Because of this, FCF should be used in combination with other financial indicators to analyze the financial health of a company. How Important Is Free Cash Flow? Free cash flow is an important financial metric because it represents the actual amount of cash at a company’s disposal . A company with consistently low or negative FCF might be forced into costly rounds of fundraising to remain solvent. If a company has enough FCF to maintain its current operations but not enough FCF to invest in growing its business, that company might eventually fall behind its competitors. For yield-oriented investors, FCF is important for understanding the reliability of a company’s dividend payments, as well as the likelihood of the company raising its dividends in the future. The Bottom Line Checking a company’s free cash flow (FCF), and especially checking the trend of free cash flow over time, can be useful to investors considering a company’s stock. Shareholders can use FCF as a gauge of the company’s ability to pay dividends or interest, while lenders may use it as a measure of a company’s ability to take on additional debt. Free cash flow isn’t listed on a company’s financial statements and must be manually calculated from other data. Many financial websites provide a summary of FCF or a graph of FCF’s trend for publicly traded companies.",
    "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp": "What Is EBITDA? EBITDA, short for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, is an alternate measure of profitability to net income . It's used to assess a company's profitability and financial performance. EBITDA is not a metric recognized under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) . Some public companies report EBITDA in their quarterly results along with adjusted EBITDA figures typically excluding additional costs, such as stock-based compensation . Increased focus on EBITDA by companies and investors has prompted criticism that it overstates profitability. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires listed companies reporting EBITDA figures to show how they were derived from net income, and it bars them from reporting EBITDA on a per-share basis. Key Takeaways Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) is a measure of core corporate profitability. EBITDA is calculated by adding interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization expenses to net income. Some critics, including Warren Buffett, call EBITDA meaningless because it omits depreciation and capital costs. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires listed companies to reconcile any EBITDA figures they report with net income and bars them from reporting EBITDA per share. Investopedia / Zoe Hansen EBITDA Formulas and Calculation If a company doesn't report EBITDA, it can be easily calculated from its financial statements . Software like Excel can make the calculation process easy . The earnings (net income), tax, and interest figures are found on the income statement , while the depreciation and amortization figures are normally found in the notes to operating profit or on the cash flow statement . There are two EBITDA formulas, one based on net income and the other on operating income, both of which will arrive at basically the same result. (Net income is operating income minus non-operating expenses, such as taxes and interest.) The respective EBITDA formulas are: EBITDA = Net Income + Taxes + Interest Expense + D&A or EBITDA = Operating Income + D&A where: D&A = Depreciation and amortization \\begin{aligned}&\\text{EBITDA} = \\text{Net Income} + \\text{Taxes} + \\text{Interest Expense} +\\text{D\\&A}\\\\&\\text{or}\\\\&\\text{EBITDA} = \\text{Operating Income} + \\text{D\\&A}\\\\&\\textbf{where:}\\\\&\\text{D\\&A}=\\text{\\text{Depreciation and amortization}}\\end{aligned} ​ EBITDA = Net Income + Taxes + Interest Expense + D&A or EBITDA = Operating Income + D&A where: D&A = Depreciation and amortization ​ What Does EBITDA Actually Tell You? By adding interest , taxes , depreciation, and amortization back to net income, EBITDA can be used to track and compare the underlying profitability of companies regardless of their depreciation assumptions or financing choices. Like earnings, EBITDA is often used in valuation ratios, notably in combination with enterprise value as EV/EBITDA, also known as the enterprise multiple . EBITDA is widely used in the analysis of asset-intensive industries with a lot of property, plant, and equipment and correspondingly high non-cash depreciation costs. In those sectors, the costs that EBITDA excludes may obscure changes in the underlying profitability—for example, as with energy pipelines. Meanwhile, amortization is often used to expense the cost of software development or other intellectual property . That's one reason early-stage technology and research companies may use EBITDA when discussing their performance. Annual changes in tax liabilities and assets that must be reflected on the income statement may not relate to operational performance. Interest costs depend on debt levels, interest rates, and management preferences regarding debt vs. equity financing. Excluding all of these items keeps the focus on the cash profits generated by the company's business. Of course, not everyone agrees. \"References to EBITDA make us shudder,\" Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRK.A ) CEO Warren Buffett has written. According to Buffett, depreciation is a real cost that can't be ignored and EBITDA is not \"a meaningful measure of performance.\" Example of EBITDA Suppose a company generates $100 million in revenue and incurs $40 million in cost of goods sold (COGS) and another $20 million in overhead . Depreciation and amortization expenses total $10 million, yielding an operating profit of $30 million. Interest expense is $5 million, leaving earnings before taxes of $25 million. With a 20% tax rate, net income equals $20 million after $5 million in taxes is subtracted from pretax income. If depreciation, amortization, interest, and taxes are added back to net income, EBITDA equals $40 million. Net Income $20,000,000 Depreciation & Amortization +$10,000,000 Interest Expense +$5,000,000 Taxes +$5,000,000 EBITDA $40,000,000 History of EBITDA EBITDA is the invention of one of the very few investors with a record rivaling Buffett's: Liberty Media Chairman John Malone. The cable industry pioneer came up with the metric in the 1970s to help sell lenders and investors on his leveraged growth strategy, which deployed debt and reinvested profits to minimize taxes. During the 1980s, the investors and lenders involved in leveraged buyouts (LBOs) found EBITDA useful in estimating whether the targeted companies had the profitability to service the debt that was expected to be incurred in the acquisition. Since a buyout would likely entail a change in the capital structure and tax liabilities, it made sense to exclude the interest and tax expense from earnings. As non-cash costs, depreciation and amortization expense would not affect the company's ability to service that debt, at least in the near term. The LBO buyers tended to target companies with minimal or modest near-term capital spending plans, while their own need to secure financing for the acquisitions led them to focus on the EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio , which weighs core operating profitability as represented by EBITDA against debt service costs. EBITDA gained notoriety during the dotcom bubble , when some companies used it to exaggerate their financial performance. The metric received more bad publicity in 2018 after WeWork Companies Inc., a provider of shared office space, filed a prospectus for its initial public offering (IPO) defining its \"Community Adjusted EBITDA\" as excluding general and administrative as well as sales and marketing expenses. Criticisms of EBITDA Because EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure, the way it is calculated can vary from one company to the next. It is not uncommon for companies to emphasize EBITDA over net income because the former makes them look better. An important red flag for investors is when a company that hasn't reported EBITDA in the past starts to feature it prominently in results. This can happen when companies have borrowed heavily or are experiencing rising capital and development costs. In those cases, EBITDA may serve to distract investors from the company's challenges. These are among the other criticisms of EBITDA: EBITDA Ignores Asset Costs A common misconception is that EBITDA represents cash earnings. However, unlike free cash flow , EBITDA ignores the cost of assets. One of the most common criticisms of EBITDA is that it assumes profitability is a function of sales and operations alone—almost as if the company's assets and debt financing were a gift. To quote Buffett again, \"Does management think the tooth fairy pays for capital expenditures?\" Earnings Figures May Be Suspect While the formulas for calculating EBITDA may seem simple enough, different companies use different earnings figures as the starting point. In other words, EBITDA is susceptible to the earnings accounting games found on the income statement. Company Valuation Can Be Obscured All the cost exclusions in EBITDA can make a company appear much less expensive than it really is. When analysts look at stock price multiples of EBITDA rather than at bottom-line earnings, they produce lower multiples. Consider the historical example of wireless telecom operator Sprint Nextel. On April 1, 2006, the stock was trading at 7.3 times its forecast EBITDA. That might sound like a low multiple, but it didn't mean that the company was a bargain. As a multiple of forecast operating profits, Sprint Nextel traded at a much-higher 20 times, and the company traded at 48 times its estimated net income. \"There's been some real sloppiness in accounting, and this move toward using adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings has produced some companies that I think are trading on valuations that are not supported by the real numbers,\" hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb said in 2015. Not much has changed on that front since then. Investors using solely EBITDA to assess a company's value or results risk getting the wrong answer. EBITDA vs. EBIT vs. EBT Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is a company's net income plus income tax and interest expenses. EBIT is used to analyze the profitability of a company's core operations. The following formula is used to calculate EBIT: EBIT = Net Income + Interest Expense + Tax Expense \\begin{aligned}\\text{EBIT}=\\text{Net Income}+\\text{Interest Expense}+\\text{Tax Expense}\\end{aligned} EBIT = Net Income + Interest Expense + Tax Expense ​ Since net income includes interest and tax expenses, to calculate EBIT, these deductions from net income must be reversed. Earnings before tax (EBT) reflects how much of an operating profit has been realized before accounting for taxes, while EBIT excludes both taxes and interest payments. EBT is calculated by adding just tax expense to the company's net income. By excluding tax liabilities , investors can use EBT to evaluate performance after eliminating a variable typically not within the company's control. In the United States, this is most useful for comparing companies that might be subject to different state tax rates or federal tax rules. Unlike EBITDA, EBT and EBIT do include the non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization. EBITDA vs. Operating Cash Flow Operating cash flow is a better measure of how much cash a company is generating because it adds non-cash charges (depreciation and amortization) back to net income while also including changes in working capital , including receivables, payables , and inventory , that use or provide cash. Working capital trends are an important consideration in determining how much cash a company is generating. If investors don't include working capital changes in their analysis and rely solely on EBITDA, they can miss clues —for example, difficulties with receivables collection —that may impair cash flow. How Do You Calculate EBITDA? The formula for calculating EBITDA is: EBITDA = Operating Income + Depreciation + Amortization. You can find this figures on a company’s income statement, cash flow statement, and balance sheet. What Is a Good EBITDA? A strong EBITDA is considered to be at least two times the company's interest expense. For example, if a company's annual interest expense is $1 million, then a strong EBITDA would be at least $2 million. In some industries, a higher EBITDA margin above 15% or more, may be considered favorable. A good EBITDA varies by industry, company size, industry norms, growth stage, and capital structure. What Is the Difference Between EBITDA and EBITA? Like EBITDA, EBITA (earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization) is a measure of a company's profitability that's used by investors and an example of a non-GAAP financial measure. EBITA is not as commonly used as EBITDA, which adds depreciation to the calculation. EBITDA may offer a better view of operating profitability in asset-heavy industries such as utilities, telecom, and manufacturing, but EBITA may be more useful for companies that don't have extensive capital expenditures that might skew the numbers. Is EBITDA the Same As Gross Profit? No, EBITDA is not the same as gross profit. While they are related, EBITDA and gross profit are distinct financial metrics. Gross profit represents revenue minus the cost of goods sold (COGS), indicating the profitability of core business operations before deducting other expenses. EBITDA, however, reflects operating performance by excluding interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, providing a clearer view of operational profitability by excluding non-operating expenses and non-cash items. What Is Amortization in EBITDA? As it relates to EBITDA, amortization is the gradual discounting of the book value of a company's intangible assets . Amortization is reported on a company's income statement. Intangible assets include intellectual property, such as patents or trademarks, as well as goodwill . The Bottom Line EBITDA can be a useful tool for comparing companies subject to disparate tax treatments and capital costs, or analyzing them in situations where these are likely to change. It also omits non-cash depreciation costs that may not accurately represent future capital spending requirements. At the same time, excluding some costs while including others has opened the door to the EBITDA's abuse by unscrupulous corporate managers. The best defense for investors against such practices is to read the fine print reconciling the reported EBITDA to net income. Correction—April 30, 2023. An earlier version of this article contained an arithmetic error in the calculation of EBITDA. The expected taxes were $5 million, not $4 million.",
    "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprisevalue.asp": "What Is Enterprise Value (EV)? Enterprise value (EV) measures a company’s total value. Its calculation includes not only the market capitalization of a company but also short-term and long-term debt, as well as any cash or cash equivalents on the company’s balance sheet. It is often used as a more comprehensive alternative to market capitalization when valuing a company. Key Takeaways Enterprise value (EV) measures a company’s total value, often used as a more comprehensive alternative to equity market capitalization. EV is calculated using information from a company's financial statement. Enterprise value takes into account the market capitalization of a company, as well as short-term and long-term debt and any cash on the company’s balance sheet. Enterprise value is used as the basis for many financial ratios that measure a company’s performance. Michela Buttignol / Investopedia How Enterprise Value (EV) Works Enterprise value (EV) differs significantly from simple market capitalization in several ways, and many consider it to be a more accurate representation of a firm’s value. EV tells investors or interested parties a company’s value and how much another company would need if it wanted to purchase that company. A company’s EV can be negative if the total value of its cash and cash equivalents surpasses that of the combined total of its market cap and debts. This is a sign that a company is not using its assets very well—it has too much cash sitting around not being used. Extra cash can be used for many things, such as distributions, buybacks, expansion, research and development, maintenance, employee pay raises, bonuses, or paying off debts. Enterprise value uses figures from a company’s financial statements and current market prices. The components that make up EV are: Market cap : The total value of a company’s outstanding common and preferred shares Debt : The sum of long-term and short-term debt Preferred equity: Preferred shares of equity need to be included as well since they are claimed on the company's equity not included in market capitalization. Minority interest : The equity value of a subsidiary with less than 50% ownership Cash and cash equivalents : The total amount of cash, certificates of deposit (CDs), drafts, money orders, commercial paper, marketable securities, money market funds, short-term government bonds, or Treasury bills that a company possesses Note Preferred shares and minority interest can be added to the market cap if these values are present. Formula and Calculation Enterprise value is the sum of a company's market capitalization and any debts, minus cash or cash equivalents on hand. E V = M C + T o t a l D e b t − C where: M C = Market capitalization; equal to the current stock price multiplied by the number of outstanding stock shares T o t a l d e b t = Equal to the sum of short-term and long-term debt C = Cash and cash equivalents; the liquid assets of a company, but may not include marketable securities \\begin{aligned} &EV=MC+Total~Debt-C\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &MC=\\text{\\small Market capitalization; equal to the current stock}\\\\ &\\text{\\small price multiplied by the number of outstanding stock shares}\\\\ &Total~debt =\\text{\\small Equal to the sum of short-term and}\\\\ &\\text{\\small long-term debt}\\\\ &C=\\text{\\small Cash and cash equivalents; the liquid assets of}\\\\ &\\text{\\small a company, but may not include marketable securities}\\\\ \\end{aligned} ​ E V = MC + T o t a l De b t − C where: MC = Market capitalization; equal to the current stock price multiplied by the number of outstanding stock shares T o t a l d e b t = Equal to the sum of short-term and long-term debt C = Cash and cash equivalents; the liquid assets of a company, but may not include marketable securities ​ To calculate market capitalization—if not readily available online—you would multiply the number of outstanding shares by the current stock price. Next, total all debt on the company’s balance sheet, including both short-term and long-term debt. Finally, add the market capitalization to the total debt and subtract any cash and cash equivalents from the result. Financial Ratios That Use Enterprise Value Enterprise value is used as the basis for many financial ratios that measure the performance of a company. For example, the enterprise multiple contains enterprise value. It relates the total value of a company from all sources to the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). EBITDA measures a company’s ability to generate revenue and is used as an alternative to simple earnings or net income in some circumstances. It is usually positive even when earnings per share (EPS) is not. EBITDA, however, can be misleading because it strips out the cost of capital investments like property, plant, and equipment. Another figure, EBIT, can be used as a similar financial metric without the drawback of removing depreciation and amortization expenses related to property, plant, and equipment (PP&E). Note EBITDA = Net Income + Interest Expense + Taxes + Depreciation + Amortization Enterprise Multiple (EV/EBITDA Ratio) The enterprise multiple (EV/EBITDA) metric is used as a valuation tool to compare the value of a company and its debt to the company’s cash earnings, less its non-cash expenses. As a result, it’s ideal for analysts and investors looking to compare companies within the same industry. The enterprise multiple is useful when: Comparing firms with different degrees of financial leverage (DFLs) Valuing capital-intensive businesses with high levels of depreciation and amortization However, the enterprise multiple also has a few drawbacks. If working capital is growing, EBITDA will overstate cash flows from operations (CFO or OCF). Further, this measure ignores how different revenue recognition policies can affect a company’s OCF. Because free cash flow to the firm captures the number of capital expenditures (CapEx) , it is more strongly linked with valuation theory than EBITDA. EBITDA will be a generally adequate measure if capital expenses equal depreciation expenses. EV/Sales Ratio Another commonly used multiple for determining the relative value of firms is the enterprise value-to-sales ratio, or EV/sales . EV/sales is regarded as a more accurate measure than the price/sales ratio since it considers the value and amount of debt that a company must repay at some point. A company with a lower EV/sales multiple is often seen as more undervalued and therefore more attractive. The EV/sales ratio can be negative when the cash held by a company is more than the market capitalization and debt value. A negative EV/sales implies that a company can pay off all of its debts. Enterprise Value vs. Market Cap Why doesn’t market capitalization properly represent a firm’s value? It leaves a lot of essential factors out, such as a company’s debt and cash reserves. Enterprise value is a modification of market cap, as it incorporates debt and cash for determining a company’s value. Important Market capitalization is not intended to represent a company’s book value. Instead, it represents a company’s value as determined by market participants. Imagine two identical widget manufacturers, Company A and Company B, have the same stock price of $4.32 per share. Each has 1 million outstanding shares with a market cap of $4.32 million. Now, imagine Company A has $500,000 in cash and cash equivalents and $250,000 in total debt. Its EV (total worth) is: ($4.32 per share x 1 million shares) + $250,000 - $500,000 = $4.07 million Company B, on the other hand, has $1 million in cash and $250,000 in debt. Its EV is: ($4.32 per share x 1 million shares) + $250,000 - $1,000,000 = $3.57 million The companies looked identical when using just their market capitalization. However, once the EV takes into account both debt and cash, the value of Company A is significantly higher. EV vs. P/E Ratio The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is a ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its earnings per share (EPS) . The price-to-earnings ratio is sometimes known as the price multiple or the earnings multiple. The P/E ratio doesn’t consider the amount of debt that a company has on its balance sheet. EV includes debt when valuing a company and is often used in tandem with the P/E ratio to achieve a comprehensive valuation. Limitations of EV EV includes total debt, so it’s essential to consider how management utilizes that debt when valuing a company. For example, capital-intensive industries such as the oil and gas industry typically carry significant amounts of debt, which is used to foster growth in ways like purchasing a plant and equipment. In a less capital-intensive industry, however, high levels of debt could indicate that a company is unable to generate enough revenue to cover the costs of basic operations. As a result, the EV can be skewed when comparing companies across industries. If the company being looked at is undergoing a merger or acquisition, the acquiring company will need to account for the amount of debt it is taking on in the merger. Investors can use this information to evaluate what the merged companies will look like in the future. As with any financial metric, it’s best to compare companies within the same industry to better understand how the company is valued relative to its peers. Example of Enterprise Value The formula for EV is the sum of the market value of equity (market capitalization) and the market value of a company’s debt, less any cash. A company’s market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the share price by the number of outstanding shares. The net debt is the market value of debt minus cash. A company acquiring another company keeps the cash of the target firm, which is why cash needs to be deducted from the firm’s price as represented by the market cap. Let’s calculate the enterprise value for Macy’s ( M ), using data from their Form 10-K. For its 2023 fiscal year, Macy’s recorded the following: Calculating Macy's Enterprise Value Feb. 3, 2024 1 # Outstanding Shares 274.3 million 2 Share Price Close on 1/30/24 $18.64 3 Market Capitalization $5.13 billion Item 1 × 2 4 Short-Term Debt $0 5 Long-Term Debt $2.998 billion 6 Total Debt $2.998 billion Item 4 + 5 7 Cash and Cash Equivalents $1.03 billion Enterprise Value $7.098 billion Item 3 + 6 - 7 We can calculate Macy’s market cap at the time from the information above. Macy’s had 274.3 million outstanding shares valued at $18.64 per share at the end of its 2023 fiscal year (Feb. 3, 2024). Macy’s market capitalization was $5.13 billion (274.3 million × $18.64). Macy’s had short-term debt of $0 and long-term debt of $2.998 billion, for a total debt of $2.998 billion. Macy’s had $1.03 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Macy’s Enterprise Value = $5.13 billion + $2.998 billion - $1.03 billion Macy’s EV = $7.098 billion Enterprise value is considered comprehensive when valuing a company because anyone purchasing Macy’s outstanding shares for its then market capitalization of $5.13 billion would also have to settle the $2.998 billion in outstanding debts that Macy's had at that time. In total, the acquiring company would have to spend more than $8 billion to purchase Macy’s. However, since Macy’s has $1.03 billion in cash, this amount could be added to repay the debt. This lowers the total needed to purchase Macy's at the end of their fiscal year 2023 to just over $7 billion. What Is Enterprise Value and Why Is It Important? Enterprise value shows a company’s total value, including debts and cash, and is generally used in mergers and acquisitions to evaluate a prospect. You might also see embedded value used to value life insurance companies, primarily in Europe. How Do You Calculate Enterprise Value? To calculate enterprise value, calculate market capitalization by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the current stock price. Next, total all debt (short- and long-term) on the company’s balance sheet. Finally, add the market capitalization to the total debt and subtract any cash and cash equivalents from the result. What Is Enterprise Value vs. Market Value? Enterprise value is the total value of a company, while market value is the value of its shares on the stock market. Market capitalization is the total value of all shares on the stock market and does not take into account the value of a company's cash or debts. The Bottom Line Enterprise value estimates a company’s total value, including debt and cash. It is generally used by companies when considering a merger or acquisition. Investors can also use EV to estimate a company’s size and worth to help them evaluate their stock choices. EV is best used with other metrics for valuing a stock. Some popular ratios are EV/sales and EV/EBITDA.",
    "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp": "Definition Market capitalization (\"market cap\") is the total value of a company's outstanding shares, used by investors to gauge its size rather than relying on sales or asset value. What Is Market Capitalization? Market capitalization, or \"market cap,\" represents the total dollar market value of a company's outstanding shares of stock. Investors use this figure to determine a company's size instead of sales or total asset value. In an acquisition, the market cap helps determine whether a takeover candidate represents a good value for the acquirer. Key Takeaways Market capitalization shows how much a company is worth as determined by the total market value of all outstanding shares. To calculate a company's market cap, multiply the number of outstanding shares by the current market value of one share. Market cap is used to determine a company's size, and then compare the company's financial performance to other companies of various sizes. Investopedia / Xiaojie Liu How to Calculate Market Cap Market capitalization estimates a company's value by extrapolating what the market thinks it is worth for publicly traded companies and multiplying the share price by the number of available shares. After a company goes public and begins trading on an exchange, its share price is determined by supply and demand . As market prices move, the market cap becomes a real-time estimate of the company's value . The formula for market capitalization is: Market Cap = Current Share Price * Total Number of Shares Outstanding A company with 20 million shares selling at $100 a share has a market cap of $2 billion. A second company with a share price of $1,000 but only 10,000 shares outstanding, has a market cap of $10 million. Important An initial public offering (IPO) helps determine a company's first market capitalization. An investment bank employs valuation techniques to derive a company's value and determine how many shares will be offered to the public and at what price. Market Cap and Company Size Large-cap companies typically have a market capitalization of $10 billion or more and represent major players in well-established industries and sectors. These companies generally reward investors with a consistent increase in share value and dividend payments. Examples of large-cap companies include Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Alphabet Inc. Mid-cap companies generally have a market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. Mid-cap companies operate in an industry expected to experience rapid growth. Mid-cap companies are in the process of expanding and carry an inherently higher risk than large-cap companies . One example of a mid-cap company is Eagle Materials Inc. ( EXP ). Companies with a market capitalization between $250 million and $2 billion are commonly classified as small-cap companies. These small companies may serve niche markets and new industries. These companies are considered higher-risk investments due to their age, the markets they serve, and their size. Small-cap share prices may be more volatile but provide greater growth opportunities than large caps. Smaller companies, known as micro-cap , have values below $250 million. Market Cap and Digital Currency Because new digital currency offerings theoretically thin the value of existing coins, tokens, or shares, a different market cap formula can be used to calculate the market cap for all authorized shares or tokens. Analysts use diluted market cap to understand potential changes to a security, token, or coin's price. The diluted market cap formula is: Diluted Market Cap = Current Share Price * Total Number of Shares Authorized Assume Bitcoin trades at $24,000 per coin, with 19.1 million Bitcoin already issued. The total number of potential Bitcoin that may be minted is 21 million. Therefore, Bitcoin's market cap calculations are: Market Cap = $24,000 * 19.1 million = $458.4 billion Diluted Market Cap = $24,000 * 21 million = $504 billion Misconceptions About Market Caps Although it is used to describe a company, market capitalization does not measure the equity value of a company. Only a thorough analysis of a company's fundamentals can do that. Shares are often over- or undervalued by the market, meaning the market price determines only how much the market is willing to pay for its shares. The market cap does not determine the amount the company would cost to acquire in a merger transaction. A better method of calculating the price of acquiring a business outright is the enterprise value . What Factors Alter a Company's Market Cap? Two factors can alter a company's market cap: significant changes in the price of a stock or when a company issues or repurchases shares. An investor who exercises a large amount of warrants can also increase the number of shares on the market and negatively affect shareholders in a process known as dilution . What Does a High Market Cap Tell You? A high market cap signifies that the company has a larger presence in the market. Larger companies may have less growth potential than start-up firms, but established companies may be able to secure financing cheaper, have a more consistent stream of revenue, and capitalize on brand recognition. Does Market Cap Affect Stock Price? Market cap does not affect stock price; rather, market cap is calculated by analyzing the stock price and number of shares issued. Although a blue-chip stock may perform better because of organizational efficiency and greater market presence, having a higher market cap does not directly impact stock prices. What Is the Importance of Market Cap? Market cap is often used as a baseline for analysis as all other financial metrics must be viewed through this lens. For example, a company could have had twice as much revenue as any other company in the industry. However, if the company's market cap is four times as large, the argument could be made that the company is underperforming. The Bottom Line Market cap can be a valuable tool for investors watching stocks and evaluating potential investments. Market capitalization is a quick and easy method for estimating a company's value by extrapolating what the market thinks it is worth for publicly traded companies. In an acquisition, the market cap helps determine whether a takeover candidate represents a good value to the acquirer.",
    "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp": "Definition Return on equity (ROE) is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing net income by shareholders' equity. What Is Return on Equity (ROE)? Return on equity (ROE) is a measure of a company's financial performance. It is calculated by dividing net income by shareholders' equity. Because shareholders' equity is equal to a company’s assets minus its debt, ROE is a way of showing a company's return on net assets . Return on equity is considered a gauge of a corporation's profitability and how efficiently it generates those profits. The higher the ROE, the more efficient a company's management is at generating income and growth from its equity financing . Key Takeaways To calculate return on equity (ROE), divide a company's net income by its shareholders' equity. ROE is a gauge of a corporation's profitability and how efficiently it generates those profits. The higher the ROE, the better a company is at converting its equity financing into profits. ROE will vary based on the sector a company is in, so it provides the most information when it's used to compare companies in the same industry. A shortcut to assessing return on equity is to compare it to the current long-term average of the S&P 500. Investopedia / Zoe Hansen How Return on Equity Works ROE is expressed as a percentage and can be calculated for any company if net income and equity are both positive numbers. Net income is calculated before dividends paid to common shareholders and after dividends to preferred shareholders and interest to lenders. Whether an ROE is deemed good or bad will depend on what is normal among a stock’s peers. For example, utilities have many assets and debt on the balance sheet compared to a relatively small amount of net income. A normal ROE in the utility sector could be 10% or less. A technology or retail firm with smaller balance sheet accounts relative to net income may have normal ROE levels of 18% or more. A good rule of thumb is to target a return on equity that is equal to or just above the average for the company's sector—those in the same business. For example, assume a company, TechCo, has maintained a steady ROE of 18% over the past few years compared to the average of its peers, which was 15%. An investor could conclude that TechCo’s management is above average at using the company’s assets to create profits. Relatively high or low ROE ratios will vary significantly from one industry group or sector to another. However, a common shortcut for investors is to consider anything less than 10% a poor return on equity and anything near the long-term average of the S&P 500 acceptable; as of the second quarter of 2024, this means an acceptable ROE would be around or above 21.71%. Calculating Return on Equity (ROE) It is considered best practice to calculate ROE based on average equity over a period because of the mismatch between the income statement and the balance sheet. ROE is calculated by comparing the proportion of net income against the amount of shareholder equity. The equation is: ROE = Net Income Shareholders’ Equity \\begin{aligned}\\textbf{ROE}=\\frac{\\textbf{Net Income}}{\\textbf{Shareholders' Equity}}\\end{aligned} ROE = Shareholders’ Equity Net Income ​ ​ Net income is calculated as the difference between net revenue and all expenses including interest and taxes. It is the most conservative measurement for a company to analyze as it deducts more expenses than other profitability measurements such as gross income or operating income. Average shareholders' equity is calculated by adding equity at the beginning of the period. The beginning and end of the period should coincide with the period during which the net income is earned. Net income over the last full fiscal year, or trailing 12 months , is found on the income statement —a sum of financial activity over that period. Shareholders' equity comes from the balance sheet —a running balance of a company’s entire history of changes in assets and liabilities. Because net income is earned over a period of time and shareholders' equity is a balance sheet account often reporting on a single specific period, an analyst should take an average equity balance. This is often done by taking the average between the beginning balance and ending balance of equity. Using Return on Equity To Evaluate Stock Performance Return on equity can be used to estimate different growth rates of a stock that an investor is considering, assuming that the ratio is roughly in line or just above its peer group average. Future Growth Rate Investors can use ROE to estimate a stock’s growth rate and the growth rate of its dividends . These two calculations are functions of each other and can be used to make an easier comparison between similar companies. To estimate a company’s future growth rate, multiply the ROE by the company’s retention ratio . The retention ratio is the percentage of net income that is retained or reinvested by the company to fund future growth. Sustainable Growth Rate Assume that there are two companies with identical ROEs and net income but different retention ratios. This means they will each have a different sustainable growth rate (SGR). The SGR is the rate a company can grow without having to borrow money to finance that growth. The formula for calculating SGR is ROE times the retention ratio (or ROE times one minus the payout ratio). For example, Company A has an ROE of 15% and has a retention ratio of 70%. For Company A, the sustainable growth rate is: 15% x 70% = 10.5% Company B also has an ROE of 15% but has a 90% retention ratio. Company B's sustainable growth rate is: 15% x 90% = 13.5% A stock that is growing at a slower rate than its sustainable rate could be undervalued, or the market may be accounting for key risks. In either case, a growth rate that is far above or below the sustainable rate warrants additional investigation. Using Return on Equity to Identify Risks A strong return on equity is a positive thing for a company. An extremely high ROE can be a good thing if net income is extremely large compared to equity because a company’s performance is so strong. However, an extremely high ROE can also be the result of a small equity account compared to net income, which indicates risk. An outsize ROE can be indicative of a number of issues, such as inconsistent profits or excessive debt. In general, both negative and extremely high ROE levels should be considered a warning sign worth investigating. Tip A return on equity that widely changes from one period to the next may also be an indicator of inconsistent use of accounting methods. Inconsistent Profits The first potential issue with a high ROE could be inconsistent profits. Imagine that a company, LossCo, has been unprofitable for several years. Each year’s losses are recorded on the balance sheet in the equity portion as a “ retained loss .” These losses are a negative value and reduce shareholders' equity. Now, assume that LossCo has had a windfall in the most recent year and has returned to profitability. The denominator in the ROE calculation is now very small after many years of losses, which makes its ROE misleadingly high. Excess Debt A second issue that could cause a high ROE is excess debt. If a company has been borrowing aggressively, it can increase ROE because equity is equal to assets minus debt. The more debt a company has, the lower its equity can fall. A common scenario is when a company borrows large amounts of debt to buy back its own stock. This can inflate earnings per share (EPS) , but it does not affect actual performance or growth rates. Negative Net Income Finally, negative net income and negative shareholders' equity can create an artificially high ROE. However, if a company has a net loss or negative shareholders’ equity, ROE should not be calculated. If shareholders’ equity is negative, the most common issue is excessive debt or inconsistent profitability. However, there are exceptions to that rule for companies that are profitable and have been using cash flow to buy back their own shares. For many companies, this is an alternative to paying dividends, and it can eventually reduce equity (buybacks are subtracted from equity) enough to turn the calculation negative. In rare cases, a negative ROE ratio could be due to a cash flow-supported share buyback program and excellent management, but this is the less likely outcome. In any case, a company with a negative ROE cannot be evaluated against other stocks with positive ROE ratios. Important It is generally less risky to consider a stock with an average or slightly above the average ROE when compared to its peer companies, rather than one that is double, triple, or even higher than its industry average. Limitations of Return on Equity There are times when return on equity can't be used to evaluate a company's performance or profitability. Negative Return on Equity A negative ROE due to the company having a net loss or negative shareholders’ equity cannot be used to analyze the company, nor can it be used to compare against companies with a positive ROE. The term ROE is a misnomer in this situation as there is no return; the more appropriate classification is to consider what the loss is on equity. Across Industries ROE often can't be used to compare different companies in differing industries. ROE varies across sectors, especially as companies have different operating margins and financing structures. In addition, larger companies with greater efficiency may not be comparable to younger firms. Tip ROE is just one of many metrics for evaluating a firm's overall financials. Investors should utilize a combination of metrics to get a full understanding of a company's financial health before investing. Return on Equity vs. Return on Invested Capital Though ROE looks at how much profit a company can generate relative to shareholders’ equity, return on invested capital (ROIC) takes that calculation a couple of steps further. The purpose of ROIC is to figure out the amount of money after dividends a company makes based on all its sources of capital, which includes shareholders' equity and debt. ROE looks at how well a company uses shareholders' equity while ROIC is meant to determine how well a company uses all its available capital to make money. Tip You can calculate a company's return on equity using Microsoft Excel . Return on Equity and DuPont Analysis Though ROE can easily be computed by dividing net income by shareholders' equity, a technique called DuPont decomposition can break down the ROE calculation into additional steps. Created by the American chemicals corporation DuPont in the 1920s, this analysis reveals which factors are contributing the most (or the least) to a firm's ROE. There are two versions of DuPont analysis. The first involves three steps: ROE = NPM × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier where: NPM = Net profit margin, the measure of operating efficiency Asset Turnover = Measure of asset use efficiency Equity Multiplier = Measure of financial leverage \\begin{aligned} &\\text{ROE} = \\text{NPM} \\times \\text{Asset Turnover} \\times \\text{Equity Multiplier} \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &\\text{NPM} = \\text{Net profit margin, the measure of operating} \\\\ &\\text{efficiency} \\\\ &\\text{Asset Turnover} = \\text{Measure of asset use efficiency} \\\\ &\\text{Equity Multiplier} = \\text{Measure of financial leverage} \\\\ \\end{aligned} ​ ROE = NPM × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier where: NPM = Net profit margin, the measure of operating efficiency Asset Turnover = Measure of asset use efficiency Equity Multiplier = Measure of financial leverage ​ ​Alternatively, the five-step version is as follows: ROE = EBT S × S A × A E × ( 1 − TR ) where: EBT = Earnings before tax S = Sales A = Assets E = Equity TR = Tax rate \\begin{aligned} &\\text{ROE} = \\frac{ \\text{EBT} }{ \\text{S} } \\times \\frac{ \\text{S} }{ \\text{A} } \\times \\frac{ \\text{A} }{ \\text{E} } \\times ( 1 - \\text{TR} ) \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &\\text{EBT} = \\text{Earnings before tax} \\\\ &\\text{S} = \\text{Sales} \\\\ &\\text{A} = \\text{Assets} \\\\ &\\text{E} = \\text{Equity} \\\\ &\\text{TR} = \\text{Tax rate} \\\\ \\end{aligned} ​ ROE = S EBT ​ × A S ​ × E A ​ × ( 1 − TR ) where: EBT = Earnings before tax S = Sales A = Assets E = Equity TR = Tax rate ​ Both the three- and five-step equations provide a deeper understanding of a company's ROE by examining what is changing in a company rather than looking at one simple ratio. As always with financial statement ratios, they should be examined against the company's history and its competitors' histories. For example, when looking at two peer companies, one may have a lower ROE. With the five-step equation, you can see whether this is because: Creditors perceive the company as riskier and charge it higher interest The company is poorly managed and has leverage that is too low Higher costs have decreased its operating profit margin Identifying sources like these leads to a better knowledge of the company and how it should be valued. What Is a Good Return on Equity? A “good” ROE will depend on the company’s industry and competitors. Though the long-term ROE for the top ten S&P 500 companies has averaged around 18.6%, specific industries can be significantly higher or lower. An industry will likely have a lower average ROE if it is highly competitive and requires substantial assets to generate revenues. Industries with relatively few players and where only limited assets are needed to generate revenues may show a higher average ROE. How Do You Calculate Return on Equity? To calculate ROE, divide the company’s net income by its average shareholders’ equity. Because shareholders’ equity is equal to assets minus liabilities, ROE is essentially a measure of the return generated on the net assets of the company. Since the equity figure can fluctuate during the accounting period in question, an average of shareholders’ equity is used. What Is the Difference Between Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE)? Return on assets (ROA) and ROE are similar in that they are both trying to gauge how efficiently the company generates its profits . However, ROE compares net income to net assets (assets minus liabilities) of the company, while ROA compares net income to the company’s assets without deducting its liabilities. In both cases, companies in industries in which operations require significant assets will likely show a lower average return. What Happens If Return on Equity Is Negative? If a company's ROE is negative, it means that there was negative net income for the period in question (i.e., a loss). This implies that shareholders are losing on their investment in the company. For new and growing companies, a negative ROE is often to be expected; however, a persistently negative ROE can be a sign of trouble. What Causes ROE to Increase? ROE will increase as net income increases, all else equal. Another way to boost ROE is to reduce the value of shareholders' equity. Since equity is equal to assets minus liabilities, increasing liabilities (e.g., taking on more debt financing) is one way to artificially boost ROE without necessarily increasing profitability. This can be amplified if that debt is used to engage in share buybacks, effectively reducing the amount of equity available. The Bottom Line Return on equity is a common financial metric that compares a company's income to its total shareholders' equity. This demonstrates a company's profitability and efficiency. Another useful calculation is the return on average equity (ROAE) . However, though ROE and ROAE can tell you how well a company is using resources to generate profit, they do not provide a full picture of a company's financing structure, industry, or performance against competition. ROE is just one of many metrics that investors can use to evaluate a company's performance, potential growth, and financial stability.",
    "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestmentcapital.asp": "Definition Return on invested capital is a metric that demonstrates how efficient a company is at using its invested capital. What Is Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)? Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a measurement of a company's efficiency in using its capital to generate profits. It is calculated by dividing net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) by invested capital. Comparing a company’s ROIC with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) reveals whether the company's invested capital is being used effectively. Key Takeaways Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a number that indicates how well a company is spending its capital on profitable projects or investments. To calculate ROIC, divide net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) by invested capital. It can be useful to compare a company's ROIC against that of its peers. A company is considered to be creating value if its ROIC exceeds its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Dennis Madamba / Investopedia Formula and Calculation of Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) The formula for ROIC is: ROIC = NOPAT Invested Capital where: NOPAT = Net operating profit after tax \\begin{aligned} &\\text{ROIC} = \\frac{ \\text{NOPAT} }{ \\text{Invested Capital} } \\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &\\text{NOPAT} = \\text{Net operating profit after tax} \\\\ \\end{aligned} ​ ROIC = Invested Capital NOPAT ​ where: NOPAT = Net operating profit after tax ​ Written another way, ROIC = (net income – dividends) / (debt + equity). The ROIC formula is calculated by assessing the value in the denominator, total capital, which is the sum of a company’s debt and equity. There are several ways to calculate this value. One is to subtract cash and non-interest-bearing current liabilities (NIBCL)—including tax liabilities and accounts payable, as long as these are not subject to interest or fees—from total assets. Another method of calculating invested capital is to add the book value of a company’s equity to the book value of its debt and then subtract non-operating assets, including cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and assets of discontinued operations. Yet another way to calculate invested capital is to obtain the working capital figure by subtracting current liabilities from current assets. Next, you obtain non-cash working capital by subtracting cash from the working capital value you just calculated. Finally, non-cash working capital is added to a company’s fixed assets. Important ROIC higher than the cost of capital means a company is healthy and growing, while ROIC lower than the cost of capital suggests an unsustainable business model. The value in the numerator can also be calculated in several ways. The most straightforward way is to subtract dividends from a company’s net income. On the other hand, because a company may have benefited from a one-time source of income unrelated to its core business—a windfall from foreign exchange rate fluctuations, for example—it is often preferable to look at net operating profit after tax (NOPAT). NOPAT is calculated by adjusting the operating profit for taxes: NOPAT = (operating profit) × (1 – effective tax rate) What ROIC Can Tell You ROIC is always calculated as a percentage and is usually expressed as an annualized or trailing 12-month value. It should be compared to a company’s cost of capital to determine whether the company is creating value. If ROIC is greater than a firm’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC)—the most commonly used cost of capital metric—value is being created and these firms will trade at a premium. A common benchmark for evidence of value creation is a return of two percentage points above the firm’s cost of capital. Fast Fact Many companies will report their effective tax rates for the quarter or fiscal year in their earnings releases, but not all companies do this—meaning it may be necessary to calculate the rate by dividing a company’s tax expense by its net income. Some firms run at a zero-return level. While they may not be destroying value, these companies have no excess capital to invest in future growth. To get a better idea of what a decent or acceptable ROIC is, you can compare companies operating in the same sector. If a company consistently delivers higher ROIC than its peer group, this suggests it is better run and more profitable. In the case of mature, established companies, comparing current ROIC with past ROIC can also be useful. ROIC Works Well Alongside Valuation Metrics ROIC provides the necessary context for other metrics such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio . Viewed in isolation, the P/E ratio might suggest a company is oversold, but the decline could be because the company is no longer generating value for shareholders at the same rate (or at all). On the other hand, companies that consistently generate high rates of return on invested capital probably deserve to trade at a premium compared with other stocks. Example of How to Use ROIC Target Corp. ( TGT ) calculates its ROIC directly in its 10-K, showing the components that went into the calculation: The ROIC calculation begins with operating income and then adds net other income to get EBIT. Operating lease interest is then added back and income taxes are subtracted to get net operating profits after tax (NOPAT). Target’s invested capital includes shareholder equity, long-term debt, and operating lease liabilities. Target subtracts cash and cash equivalents from the sum of those figures to get its invested capital and reports an after-tax return on invested capital of 16.1%, which is an improvement over the previous year’s 12.6%. Limitations of Using ROIC ROIC is one of the most important and informative valuation metrics . However, it is more important in some sectors than others. Some companies, such as those that operate oil rigs or manufacture semiconductors, invest capital much more intensively than those that require less equipment. A major downside of this metric is that it tells nothing about what segment of the business is generating value. If you make your calculation based on net income (minus dividends) instead of NOPAT, the result can be even more opaque, since the return may derive from a single, nonrecurring event. What Is Invested Capital? Invested capital is the total amount of money raised by a company by issuing securities—which is the sum of the company’s equity, debt, and capital lease obligations. Invested capital is not a line item in the company’s financial statement because debt, capital leases, and shareholder equity are each listed separately on the balance sheet. What Does Return on Invested Capital Tell You? Return on invested capital (ROIC) indicates how efficiently a company puts the capital under its control toward profitable investments or projects . The ROIC ratio gives a sense of how well a company is using the money it has raised to generate returns. Comparing a company’s return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) reveals whether invested capital is being used effectively. How Do You Calculate ROIC? The ROIC formula is net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) divided by invested capital. Companies with a steady or improving return on capital are unlikely to put significant amounts of new capital to work. Investors and analysts might also use the return on new invested capital (RONIC) calculation to determine the value of deploying new or additional capital to a new or existing project. The Bottom Line ROIC is a widely used financial metric. It tells us how well a company uses its capital and whether it is creating value with its investments. At a minimum, a company’s ROIC should be higher than its cost of capital. If it consistently isn’t, then the business model is not sustainable. ROIC is particularly useful when examining companies in industries that rely on investing a large amount of capital. Like many metrics, it is most informative when used to compare similar companies operating in the same sector. Often, the companies in a sector with the highest ROICs will trade at a premium.",
    "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp": "What Is Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)? Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is a company's average after-tax cost of capital from all sources, including common stock, preferred stock, bonds, and other forms of debt. It represents the average rate that a company expects to pay to finance its business. WACC is a common way to determine the required rate of return (RRR) because it expresses, in a single number, the return that bondholders and shareholders demand in return for providing the company with capital . A company's WACC is likely to be higher if its stock is relatively volatile or if its debt is considered risky because investors will want greater returns to compensate them for the level of risk. Key Takeaways Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) represents a company's cost of capital, with each category of capital (debt and equity) proportionately weighted. WACC can be calculated by multiplying the cost of each capital source by its relevant weight in terms of market value, then adding the results together to determine the total. WACC is commonly used as a hurdle rate against which companies and investors can gauge the desirability of a given project or acquisition. WACC is also used as the discount rate for future cash flows in discounted cash flow analysis. Jessica Olah / Investopedia Understanding WACC Calculating a company's WACC is useful for investors and stock analysts, as well company management. Each group will use WACC for different purposes. In corporate finance, determining a company's cost of capital can be important for several reasons. For instance, WACC can be used as the discount rate for estimating the net present value of a project or acquisition. If the company believes that a merger, for example, will generate a return higher than its cost of capital, then it's likely a good choice for the company. However, if it anticipates a return lower than its investors are expecting, there might be better uses for that capital. To investors, WACC is an important tool in assessing a company's potential for profitability. In most cases, a lower WACC indicates a healthy business that's able to attract money from investors at a lower cost. A higher WACC usually coincides with businesses that are seen as riskier and need to compensate investors with higher returns to offset the level of volatility. If a company only obtains financing through one source—say, common stock—then calculating its cost of capital would be relatively simple. If investors expected a rate of return (RoR) of 10% on their shares , the company's cost of capital would be the same as its cost of equity: 10%. The same would be true if the company only used debt financing. For example, if the company paid an average yield of 5% on its bonds, its pre-tax cost of debt would be 5%. However, because interest payments are tax-deductible, the after-tax cost of debt would be lower, calculated as 5% × (1 - tax rate). This after-tax cost of debt would also represent the company's cost of capital in this scenario, since all the capital is debt. However, many companies use both debt and equity financing in various proportions. This is where the calculation for WACC becomes valuable. WACC Formula and Calculation WACC is found by determining the proportions of debt and equity financing that a company uses to determine the total cost of capital. The equation is: WACC = ( E V × R e ) + ( D V × R d × ( 1 − T c ) ) where: E = Market value of the firm’s equity D = Market value of the firm’s debt V = E + D R e = Cost of equity R d = Cost of debt T c = Corporate tax rate \\begin{aligned} &\\text{WACC} = \\left ( \\frac{ E }{ V} \\times Re \\right ) + \\left ( \\frac{ D }{ V} \\times Rd \\times ( 1 - Tc ) \\right ) \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &E = \\text{Market value of the firm's equity} \\\\ &D = \\text{Market value of the firm's debt} \\\\ &V = E + D \\\\ &Re = \\text{Cost of equity} \\\\ &Rd = \\text{Cost of debt} \\\\ &Tc = \\text{Corporate tax rate} \\\\ \\end{aligned} ​ WACC = ( V E ​ × R e ) + ( V D ​ × R d × ( 1 − T c ) ) where: E = Market value of the firm’s equity D = Market value of the firm’s debt V = E + D R e = Cost of equity R d = Cost of debt T c = Corporate tax rate ​ WACC is calculated by multiplying the cost of each capital source (debt and equity) by its relevant weight and then adding those results together. In the above formula, E/V (equity over total financing) represents the proportion of equity-based financing, while D/V (debt over total financing) represents the proportion of debt-based financing. The WACC formula thus involves the summation of two terms: ( E V × R e ) \\left ( \\frac{ E }{ V} \\times Re \\right ) ( V E ​ × R e ) ( D V × R d × ( 1 − T c ) ) \\left ( \\frac{ D }{ V} \\times Rd \\times ( 1 - Tc ) \\right ) ( V D ​ × R d × ( 1 − T c ) ) The former represents the weighted value of equity capital, while the latter represents the weighted value of debt capital. Suppose that a company obtained $1 million in debt financing and $4 million in equity financing by selling common shares. The total capital would be $5 million (debt plus equity), so tose proportions would be: E/V = $4,000,000 / $5,000,000 = 0.8 D/V = $1,000,000 / $5,000,000 = 0.2 You can double check that the proportions are correct because 0.8 + 0.2 = 1.0. Tip WACC can be calculated using Excel . Special Considerations Calculating Cost of Equity Cost of equity (Re in the formula) can be a bit tricky to calculate because share capital does not technically have an explicit value. When companies reimburse bondholders, the amount they pay has a predetermined interest rate . On the other hand, equity has no concrete price that the company must pay. As a result, companies have to estimate the cost of equity (the rate of return that investors demand based on the expected volatility of the stock). Because shareholders will expect to receive a certain return on their investment in a company, the equity holders' required rate of return is a cost from the company's perspective; if the company fails to deliver this expected return, shareholders may simply sell their shares, which can lead to a decrease in both share price and the company's value. Important The cost of equity is the total return that a company must generate to maintain a share price that will satisfy its investors. Companies typically use the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) to arrive at the cost of equity (in CAPM, it's called the expected return of investment). Its important to note that this is not an exact calculation because companies have to lean on historical data, which can never accurately predict future growth. Calculating Cost of Debt Determining cost of debt (Rd in the formula), on the other hand, is a more straightforward process. This is often done by averaging the yield to maturity for a company's outstanding debts. This method is easier if you're looking at a publicly traded company that has to report its debt obligations. For privately owned companies, you can look at the company's credit rating from firms such as Moody's and S&P Global and then add a relevant spread over risk-free assets to approximate the return that investors would demand. Tip Treasury bonds of the same maturity are a useful risk-free asset to use as a benchmark. Businesses are able to deduct interest expenses from their taxes. Because of this, the net cost of a company's debt is the amount of interest it is paying minus the amount of interest it can deduct on its taxes. This is why Rd x (1 - the corporate tax rate) is used to calculate the after-tax cost of debt. WACC vs. Required Rate of Return (RRR) The required rate of return is the minimum return that an investor will accept in exchange for their investment. If they expect that returns will be smaller than this number, they will put their money in a different investment. One way to determine the RRR is by using the capital asset pricing model, which looks at a stock's volatility relative to the broader market (known as its beta ). This is then used to estimate the return that stockholders will require. Another method for identifying the RRR is by calculating WACC. The advantage of using WACC is that it takes the company's capital structure into account (how much it leans on debt financing vs. equity). This can give a more accurate picture of investors' expectations. Limitations of WACC Like any metric used to assess the financial strength of a business, there are limitations to using the weighted average cost of capital. The biggest limitation is in calculating WACC: the formula can appear easier to calculate than it is. There are a few different reasons for this: Inconsistent numbers : Certain elements of the formula, such as the cost of equity, are not consistent values. As a result, different parties may report different numbers. Complex structures : It can be difficult to calculate WACC when dealing with companies that have more complex balance sheets, such as ones using multiple types of debt with various interest rates. Number of inputs : There are many inputs to calculating WACC , such as interest rates and tax rates, all of which can be affected by market and economic conditions. The best way to use WACC is in combination with other financial metrics. Especially when deciding whether or not to invest, you should always try to obtain as comprehensive a picture of a company's financial health and potential for growth as possible. Example of How to Use WACC Consider a hypothetical manufacturer called XYZ Brands. Suppose the market value of the company's debt is $1 million, and its market capitalization (or the market value of its equity) is $4 million. Let's further assume that XYZ's cost of equity—the minimum return that shareholders demand—is 10%. Here, E/V would equal 0.8 ($4,000,000 of equity value divided by $5,000,000 of total financing). Therefore: Weighted cost of equity = 0.8 × 0.10 = 0.08 This is the first half of the WACC equation. Now we have to figure out XYZ's weighted cost of debt. To do this, we need to determine D/V; in this case, that's 0.2 ($1,000,000 in debt divided by $5,000,000 in total capital). Next, we would multiply that figure by the company's cost of debt, which we'll say is 5%. Last, we multiply the product of those two numbers by 1 minus the tax rate. If the tax rate (Tc) is 0.25, then \"1 minus Tc\" is equal to 0.75. Therefore: Weighted cost of debt = (0.2 × 0.05) x 0.75 = 0.0075 Adding those two numbers together gives the weighted average cost of capital: WACC = 0.08 + 0.0075 = 0.0875 = 8.75% This value represents XYZ's average cost to attract investors and the return that they're going to expect, given the company's financial strength and risk compared with other investment opportunities. What Is a Good Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)? What represents a \"good\" weighted average cost of capital will vary from company to company, depending on a variety of factors (whether it is an established business or a startup, its capital structure, the industry in which it operates, etc). One way to judge a company's WACC is to compare it to the average for its industry or sector. For example, according to Kroll research, the average WACC for companies in the consumer staples sector was 7.9% in March 2024, while it was 11.3% in the information technology sector. What Is Capital Structure? Companies use various means to obtain the capital they need, which can include issuing bonds (debt) and shares of stock (equity). Capital structure refers to how they mix the two. What Is a Debt-to-Equity Ratio? A debt-to-equity ratio is another way of looking at the risk that investing in a particular company may hold. It compares a company's liabilities to the value of its shareholder equity. The higher the debt-to-equity ratio, the riskier a company is often considered to be. The Bottom Line The value of a company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is that company's cost of capital, with both debt and equity proportionately weighted. It can be used to gauge how good, or how risky, an investment in a project or business might be. WACC is a useful measure for both investors and company executives. However, it does have limitations, particularly in how complex the calculation can become. Like other financial metrics used by investors or businesses, it should not be used in isolation. Instead, it should be just one part of a comprehensive review of a company's financial strength.",
    "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonassets.asp": "Definition Return on assets is a financial ratio used in analysis that demonstrates how a company is using its assets to generate profits. What Is the Return on Assets (ROA) Ratio? Return on assets (ROA) is a financial ratio that indicates how profitable a company is relative to its total assets . Corporate management, analysts, and investors can use the return on assets ratio to determine how efficiently a company uses its resources to generate a profit. Key Takeaways Return on assets (ROA) is a ratio that indicates a company’s profitability relative to its total assets. ROA can be used by management, analysts, and investors to determine whether a company uses its assets efficiently to generate a profit. You can calculate a company’s ROA by dividing its net income by its total assets. It’s always best to compare the ROA of companies within the same industry because they share the same asset base. ROA factors in a company’s debt. Return on equity does not. Theresa Chiechi / Investopedia Understanding Return on Assets (ROA) Ratio The return on assets ratio is commonly expressed as a percentage using a company’s net income and average assets. A higher ROA means a company is more efficient and productive at managing its balance sheet to generate profits. A lower ROA indicates there's room for improvement. Businesses are about efficiency . Comparing profits to revenue is a useful operational metric but comparing them to the resources a company used to earn them displays the feasibility of that company’s existence. Return on assets is the simplest of these corporate bang-for-the-buck measures. It reveals what earnings are generated from invested capital or assets. ROA for public companies can vary substantially and are highly dependent on the industry in which they function. The ROA for a tech company won’t necessarily correspond to that of a food and beverage company. It's best to compare a company's ROA against its previous ROA numbers or a similar company’s ROA when using it as a comparative measure. The ROA figure gives investors an idea of how effective the company is in converting the money it invests into net income . The higher the ROA number, the better because the company can earn more money with a smaller investment. A higher ROA means more asset efficiency. A similar valuation concept is a return on average assets (ROAA) which uses the average value of assets instead of the current value of the item. Financial institutions often use ROAA to gauge financial performance. Return on Assets Ratio: Formula and Calculation The return on assets ratio is calculated by dividing a company’s net income by its total assets. It’s expressed as a formula like this: R e t u r n o n A s s e t s = N e t I n c o m e T o t a l A s s e t s Return\\ on\\ Assets = \\frac{Net\\ Income}{Total\\ Assets} R e t u r n o n A sse t s = T o t a l A sse t s N e t I n co m e ​ Let's say that Sam and Milan both start hot dog stands. Sam spends $1,500 on a bare-bones metal cart. Milan spends $15,000 on a zombie apocalypse-themed unit, complete with costume. Let’s assume that those were the only assets each firm deployed. Milan would have the more valuable business but Sam would have the more efficient one if Sam earned $150 and Milan earned $1,200 over a given period. Sam’s simplified ROA is $150 ÷ $1,500 = 10% using the above formula. Milan’s simplified ROA is $1,200 ÷ $15,000 = 8%. Special Considerations Total assets are also the sum of its total liabilities and shareholder equity because of the balance sheet accounting equation . Both types of financing are used to fund a company’s operations. A company’s assets are either funded by debt or equity so some analysts and investors disregard the cost of acquiring the asset by adding back interest expense in the formula for ROA. The impact of taking more debt is negated by adding back the cost of borrowing to the net income and using the average assets in a given period as the denominator. Interest expense is added because the net income amount on the income statement excludes interest expense. Tip ROA shouldn’t be the only determining factor when it comes to making your investment decisions. It’s just one of the many metrics available to evaluate a company’s profitability. Return on Assets (ROA) vs. Return on Equity (ROE) Both ROA and return on equity (ROE) measure how well a company uses its resources . But one of the key differences between the two is how they each treat a company’s debt. ROA factors in how leveraged a company is or how much debt it carries. Its total assets include any capital it borrows to run its operations. ROE only measures the return on a company’s equity which leaves out its liabilities . ROA accounts for a company’s debt and ROE does not. The more leverage and debt a company takes on, the higher ROE will be relative to ROA. A company's ROE would be higher than its ROA as it takes on more debt. Assets are now higher than equity and the denominator of the return on assets calculation is higher because assets are higher, assuming returns are constant. A company’s ROA falls as its ROE stays at its previous level. Limitations of the ROA Ratio One of the greatest issues with the return on assets ratio is that it can’t be used across industries because companies in one industry have different asset bases from those in another. The asset bases of companies within the oil and gas industry aren’t the same as those in the retail industry. Some analysts also feel that the basic ROA formula is limited in its applications because it's most suitable for banks. Bank balance sheets better represent the real value of their assets and liabilities because they’re carried at market value via mark-to-market accounting or at least an estimate of market value versus historical cost. Debt and equity capital are strictly segregated for nonfinancial companies as are the returns to each: Interest expense is the return for debt providers Net income is the return for equity investors The ROA calculation has an inconsistent numerator and denominator. The numerator shows returns to equity investors or net income but the denominator shows assets funded by both debt and equity investors or total assets. Two variations on this ROA formula fix this numerator/denominator inconsistency by putting interest expense net of taxes back into the numerator. The formulas would be: ROA Variation 1 : Net Income + [Interest Expense × (1 - Tax Rate)] ÷ Total Assets ROA Variation 2 : Operating Income × (1 - Tax Rate) ÷ Total Assets Important The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis provided data on U.S. bank ROAs from 1984 through the end of 2020 when the bank stopped reporting banking industry ROE. The institutions hovered under 1.4% during that time. Example of ROA Ratio The return on assets ratio is most useful for comparing companies in the same industry because different industries use assets in varying ways. The ROA for service-oriented firms such as banks will be significantly higher than the ROA for capital-intensive companies such as construction or utility companies. Let’s evaluate the normalized ROA for three companies in the retail industry: Macy’s ( M ) Kohl’s ( KSS ) Dillard’s ( DDS ) The data in this table is accurate as of Jan. 31, 2024, according to Macrotrends and Yahoo! Finance. This table is normalized. It doesn't include non-recurring expenses. Retail Sector Stocks Company Net Income Total Assets ROA Macy’s $105 million $16.2 billion 0.06% Kohl’s $317 million $14.1 billion 2.2% Dillard’s $738 million $3.4 billion 21.7% Dillard's was far better than Kohl’s or Macy's at converting its investment into profits. Every dollar that Dillard's invested in assets generated almost 22 cents of net income. One of management’s most important jobs is to make wise choices in allocating its resources and it appears that Dillard's management was more adept than its two peers at the reported time. How Is ROA Used by Investors? Investors can use ROA to find stock opportunities because the ROA shows how efficient a company is at using its assets to generate profits. A ROA that rises over time indicates that the company is doing well at increasing its profits with each investment dollar it spends. A falling ROA indicates that the company might have over-invested in assets that have failed to produce revenue growth. This is a sign the company may be in some trouble. ROA can also be used to make apples-to-apples comparisons across companies in the same sector or industry. How Can I Calculate a Company’s ROA? ROA is calculated by dividing a firm’s net income by the average of its total assets. It's then expressed as a percentage. Net profit can be found at the bottom of a company’s income statement and assets are found on its balance sheet. Average total assets are used in calculating ROA because a company’s asset total can vary over time due to the purchase or sale of vehicles, land, equipment, inventory changes, or seasonal sales fluctuations. Calculating the average total assets for the period in question is more accurate than the total assets for one period as a result. What Is Considered a Good ROA? A ROA of over 5% is generally considered good. Over 20% is excellent. ROAs should always be compared among firms in the same sector, however. A software maker has far fewer assets on the balance sheet than a car maker. The software company’s assets will be understated and its ROA may get a questionable boost as a result. The Bottom Line Return on assets (ROA) is a financial ratio that indicates how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. It's commonly expressed as a percentage using a company’s net income and average assets. ROA can be used by corporate managers, analysts, and investors to figure out how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate a profit.",
    "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda-margin.asp": "What Is EBITDA Margin? The acronym EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The EBITDA margin is a measure of a company’s operating profit as a percentage of its revenue. Knowing the EBITDA margin allows for a comparison of one company’s real performance with the performance of others in the same industry. Key Takeaways The EBITDA margin is a performance metric that investors and analysts use to measure a company’s profitability from operations. EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. EBITDA is an earnings measure that focuses on the essentials of a business: its operating profitability and cash flows. The EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing EBITDA by revenue. Sydney Saporito / Investopedia Understanding EBITDA Margin A company’s interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization all have important implications for a business’s finances. However, EBITDA strips all of those numbers out in order to focus on the essentials: operating profitability and cash flow . EBITDA margin = (earnings before interest and tax + depreciation + amortization) / total revenue This makes it easy to compare the relative profitability of two or more companies of different sizes in the same industry. Otherwise, the numbers could be skewed by short-term issues or disguised by accounting maneuvers. Calculating a company’s EBITDA margin is helpful when gauging the effectiveness of a company’s cost-cutting efforts. The higher a company’s EBITDA margin is, the lower its operating expenses are in relation to total revenue . So, a firm with revenue totaling $125,000 and EBITDA of $15,000 would have an EBITDA margin of: $15,000/$125,000 = 0.12 = 12% Alternatives to EBITDA Margin There are a couple of alternatives to EBITDA that are used by investors and analysts seeking to understand a company’s profitability: EBITA : Earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization EBIT : Earnings before interest and taxes In any case, the formula for determining operating profitability is a simple one. EBITDA (or EBITA or EBIT) divided by total revenue equals operating profitability. Important Any of these numbers—EBITDA, EBITA, or EBIT—can be used to analyze a company’s profitability. However, when comparing profitability between two or more companies, it’s important to always use the same calculation to get the most accurate results. Special Considerations EBITDA is known as a non-GAAP financial figure, meaning it does not follow generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The GAAP standards are critical in ensuring the overall accuracy of financial reporting, but they can be superfluous to financial analysts and investors. That is, interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization are not part of a company’s operating costs and are therefore not associated with the day-to-day operation of a business or its relative success. However, EBITDA is calculated using GAAP results from a business’s financial statements. Advantages and Disadvantages of EBITDA Margin The EBITDA margin tells an investor or analyst how much operating cash is generated for each dollar of revenue earned. The benefit of this calculation is that it can be used as a comparative benchmark to compare businesses within the same industry. For example, a small company might earn $125,000 in annual revenue and have an EBITDA margin of 12%, while a larger company might earn $1,250,000 in annual revenue but have an EBITDA margin of 5%. This indicates that the smaller company operates more efficiently and maximizes its profitability . The larger company, on the other hand, probably focused on volume growth to increase its bottom line . Fast Fact A good EBITDA margin is relative. However, a higher number in comparison with its peers in the same industry or sector indicates a greater level of profitability. Pitfalls of EBITDA The exclusion of debt has its drawbacks when measuring the performance of a company. Some companies highlight their EBITDA margins as a way to draw attention away from their debt and enhance the perception of their financial performance . Companies with high debt levels should not be measured using the EBITDA margin. Large interest payments should be included in the financial analysis of such companies. In addition, the EBITDA margin is usually higher than the profit margin . Companies with low profitability will emphasize EBITDA margin as their measurement for success. Finally, companies using the EBITDA figure are allowed more discretion in calculating it because EBITDA isn’t regulated by GAAP . In other words, a firm can skew the figure in its favor. Why Is EBITDA Margin Useful? EBITDA focuses on operating profitability and cash flow. This makes it easy to compare the relative profitability of two or more companies of different sizes in the same industry. Calculating a company’s EBITDA margin is helpful when gauging the effectiveness of a company’s cost-cutting efforts. If a company has a higher EBITDA margin, this means that its operating expenses are lower in relation to total revenue. Is EBITDA Margin the Same As Operating Margin? The EBITDA margin and operating profit margin are two different metrics that measure a company’s profitability. Operating margin measures a company’s profit after paying variable costs but before paying interest or tax. EBITDA, on the other hand, measures a company’s overall profitability, but it may not take into account the cost of capital investments such as property and equipment. What Are the Advantages of EBITDA Margin? The EBITDA margin measures a company’s operating profit as a percentage of its revenue, revealing how much operating cash is generated for each dollar of revenue earned. Therefore, a good EBITDA margin is a relatively high number compared with its peers. The simplicity of using one metric as a comparative benchmark can be helpful to investors. What Are the Disadvantages of EBITDA Margin? The EBITDA margin excludes debt in its calculation of a company’s performance. Some companies highlight their EBITDA margins as a way to draw attention away from their debt and enhance the perception of their financial performance. The EBITDA margin is usually higher than profit margin, which encourages companies with low profitability to feature it when emphasizing their success. Also, EBITDA isn’t regulated by GAAP. The Bottom Line EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The EBITDA margin is a measure of a company’s operating profit as a percentage of its revenue. EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing EBITDA by total revenue. EBITDA margin lets investors and financial analysts easily compare the profitability of multiple companies in the same sector or industry. However, it isn’t the best measurement for all businesses. EBITDA doesn’t take debt into account, which can give a misleading picture of the financial position of high-debt companies. It can also be used to disguise a low profit margin. Because of these limitations, EBITDA should be just one of several metrics that investors use to analyze the performance of a business.",
    "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingmargin.asp": "Definition The operating margin measures a company's profit per dollar of sales after covering variable production costs like wages and raw materials, but before accounting for interest and taxes. What Is Operating Margin? The operating margin measures how much profit a company makes on a dollar of sales after paying for variable costs of production, such as wages and raw materials, but before paying interest or tax. It is calculated by dividing a company’s operating income by its net sales . Higher ratios are generally better, illustrating the company is efficient in its operations and is good at turning sales into profits. Key Takeaways The operating margin represents how efficiently a company is able to generate profit through its core operations. It is expressed on a per-sale basis after accounting for variable costs but before paying any interest or taxes (EBIT). Higher margins are considered better than lower margins, and can be compared between similar competitors but not across different industries. To calculate the operating margin, divide operating income (earnings) by sales (revenues). Investopedia / Julie Bang Understanding the Operating Margin A company’s operating margin, sometimes referred to as return on sales (ROS), is a good indicator of how well it is being managed and how efficient it is at generating profits from sales. It shows the proportion of revenues that are available to cover non-operating costs, such as paying interest , which is why investors and lenders pay close attention to it. Highly variable operating margins are a prime indicator of business risk. By the same token, looking at a company’s past operating margins is a good way to gauge whether a company's performance has been getting better. The operating margin can improve through better management controls, more efficient use of resources, improved pricing, and more effective marketing. In its essence, the operating margin is how much profit a company makes from its core business in relation to its total revenues. This allows investors to see if a company is generating income primarily from its core operations or from other means, such as investing. Calculating the Operating Margin The formula for operating margin is: ﻿ Operating Margin = Operating Earnings Revenue \\begin{aligned} \\text{Operating Margin}=\\frac{\\text{Operating Earnings}}{\\text{Revenue}} \\end{aligned} Operating Margin = Revenue Operating Earnings ​ ​ ﻿﻿ When calculating operating margin, the numerator uses a firm's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). EBIT, or operating earnings , is calculated simply as revenue minus cost of goods sold (COGS) and the regular selling, general, and administrative costs of running a business, excluding interest and taxes. Example For example, if a company had revenues of $2 million, COGS of $700,000, and administrative expenses of $500,000, its operating earnings would be $2 million - ($700,000 + $500,000) = $800,000. Its operating margin would then be $800,000 / $2 million = 40%. If the company was able to negotiate better prices with its suppliers, reducing its COGS to $500,000, then it would see an improvement in its operating margin to 50%. Limitations of the Operating Margin The operating margin should only be used to compare companies that operate in the same industry and, ideally, have similar business models and annual sales. Companies in different industries with wildly different business models have very different operating margins, so comparing them would be meaningless. It would not be an apples-to-apples comparison. To make it easier to compare profitability between companies and industries , many analysts use a profitability ratio that eliminates the effects of financing, accounting, and tax policies: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). For example, by adding back depreciation, the operating margins of big manufacturing firms and heavy industrial companies are more comparable. EBITDA is sometimes used as a proxy for operating cash flow because it excludes non-cash expenses, such as depreciation. However, EBITDA does not equal cash flow. This is because it does not adjust for any increase in working capital or account for capital expenditure that is needed to support production and maintain a company’s asset base—as operating cash flow does. Other Profit Margins By comparing EBIT to sales, operating profit margins show how successful a company's management has been at generating income from the operation of the business.  There are several other margin calculations that businesses and analysts can employ to get slightly different insights into a firm's profitability. The gross margin tells us how much profit a company makes on its cost of sales or COGS. In other words, it indicates how efficiently management uses labor and supplies in the production process. The net margin considers the net profits generated from all segments of a business, accounting for all costs and accounting items incurred, including taxes and depreciation. In other words, this ratio compares net income with sales. It comes as close as possible to summing up in a single figure how effectively the managers are running a business. Why Is Operating Margin Important? The operating margin is an important measure of a company's overall profitability from operations. It is the ratio of operating profits to revenues for a company or business segment. Expressed as a percentage, the operating margin shows how much earnings from operations is generated from every $1 in sales after accounting for the direct costs involved in earning those revenues. Larger margins mean that more of every dollar in sales is kept as profit. How Can Companies Improve Their Operating Profit Margin? When a company's operating margin exceeds the average for its industry, it is said to have a competitive advantage , meaning it is more successful than other companies that have similar operations. While the average margin for different industries varies widely, businesses can gain a competitive advantage in general by increasing sales or reducing expenses —or both. Boosting sales, however, often involves spending more money to do so, which equals greater costs. Cutting too many costs can also lead to undesirable outcomes, including losing skilled workers, shifting to inferior materials, or other losses in quality. Cutting advertising budgets may also harm sales. To reduce the cost of production without sacrificing quality, the best option for many businesses is expansion. Economies of scale refer to the idea that larger companies tend to be more profitable. A large business's increased level of production means that the cost of each item is reduced in several ways. For example, raw materials purchased in bulk are often discounted by wholesalers. How Is Operating Margin Different From Other Profit Margin Measures? Operating margin takes into account all operating costs but excludes any non-operating costs. Net profit margin takes into account all costs involved in a sale, making it the most comprehensive and conservative measure of profitability. Gross margin, on the other hand, simply looks at the costs of goods sold (COGS) and ignores things such as overhead , fixed costs, interest expenses, and taxes. What Are Some High and Low Profit Margin Industries? High-profit margin sectors are typically those where competitive pressures allow companies to generate sales that are produced without having to spend much on development, marketing, overheads, and production. Initially, start-up companies may make losses until they establish themselves. For example, software or gaming companies may invest initially while developing a particular software/game and cash in big later by simply selling millions of copies with very few expenses. Operations-intensive businesses such as transportation, which may have to deal with fluctuating fuel prices, drivers’ perks and retention, and vehicle maintenance, usually have lower profit margins. Automobiles also have low profit margins, as profits and sales are limited by intense competition, uncertain consumer demand, and high operational expenses involved in developing dealership networks and logistics.",

What Is Net Profit Margin? Net profit margin (otherwise known as net margin) is a measure of how much profit (or net income ) a business generates. Most often, the net profit margin is shown as a percentage but may also be represented by a decimal. The net profit margin shows how much of each dollar a business earns actually translates into profit. It’s calculated by dividing a company’s net income by its total revenue and multiplying that figure by 100. We’ll take a deeper dive into the net profit margin formula, including both hypothetical and real examples later in this article. Key Takeaways Net profit margin is a true measure of a business’s profit represented as a percentage of its revenue. Net profit margin is a crucial metric in determining the overall financial standing of a business. Investors often rely on net profit margin as a key indicator of a company’s financial health and potential for growth. Tip Take a look at a company’s net profit margin as a first assessment of its overall value. How Net Profit Margin Works Net profit margin is one of the most comprehensive profitability metrics, as it includes all factors of a company’s operation. Carefully tracking fluctuations in net profit margin allows businesses to determine whether their current strategy is effective and accurately predict profits based on current revenue. Since net profit margin is typically expressed as a percentage, it’s simple to compare the profitability of two or more companies even if they vary in size and scope. Net profit margin includes all the below factors in a business's operations: Total revenue Cost of goods sold (COGS) and various additional expenses Investment income and any income earned from secondary operations Any interest expenses incurred on debt Corporate tax expenses Timely payments for unusual events, such as business structuring or legal expenses A business’s net profit margin is an important metric for investors to determine the profitability of a company and whether or not the business is a good investment. Generally, if a business has a growing revenue, but its operating expenses are increasing, its net profit margin will decrease. Maintaining a strong record of increasing profit margins coupled with shrinking expenses may make a business more attractive to prospective investors . Tip A company can regularly review costs and pricing strategies to optimize revenue and increase its net profit margin. Formula and Calculation for Net Profit Margin To calculate net profit margin, use the following formula: Net profit margin = R − C O G S − E − I − T R ∗ 100 = Net income R ∗ 100 where: R = Revenue C O G S = The cost of goods sold E = Operating and other expenses I = Interest T = Taxes \\begin{aligned} \\text{Net profit margin} &= \\frac{R - COGS - E - I - T}{R}*100\\\\ &= \\frac{\\text{Net income}}{R}*100\\\\ \\textbf{where:}\\\\ R &= \\text{Revenue}\\\\ COGS &= \\text{The cost of goods sold}\\\\ E &= \\text{Operating and other expenses}\\\\ I &= \\text{Interest}\\\\ T &= \\text{Taxes} \\end{aligned} Net profit margin where: R COGS E I T ​ = R R − COGS − E − I − T ​ ∗ 100 = R Net income ​ ∗ 100 = Revenue = The cost of goods sold = Operating and other expenses = Interest = Taxes ​ Where: Net Income = Revenue - all costs and expenses (including COGS, operating expenses, taxes, interest, and any other costs). Total Revenue = The total sales or revenue generated by the company. Subtract the cost of goods sold (COGS), operating expenses and other expenses, interest owed, and any applicable taxes from the total revenue. Divide that result by total revenue. Turn that figure into a percentage by multiplying it by 100. Examples of Net Profit Margin Here’s a hypothetical example of net profit margin for Company X: Revenue: $150,000 COGS or cost of goods sold: $30,000 Operating costs: $30,000 Interest: $5,000 Tax liability: $18,000 Net profits: $67,000 In this case, Company X’s net profit margin is 44.6% ($67,000 ÷ $150,000 x 100). A 44.6% profit margin indicates that a business earns around 44 to 45 cents in profit for every dollar it collects. Here’s a real-world example of net profit margin: Source: Microsoft Pictured above is the financial statement for Microsoft Corporation for the three months ending September 30, 2024 (left column labeled 2024): Net sales (total revenue) was $65.6 billion (top section of the chart). Net income was $24.7 billion for the period (bottom section of the chart). Microsoft’s net profit margin is calculated by dividing its total net income of $24.7 billion by its net sales (total revenue) of $65.6 billion and multiplying that figure by 100. So, Microsoft’s net profit margin for the period was 37.7% ($24.7 billion ÷ $65.6 billion × 100). Net Profit Margin vs. Gross Profit Margin Gross profit margin is how much money is left over from total revenue after subtracting the cost of cost of goods sold (COGS). COGS measures the direct costs associated with the production of goods and services. It may include elements such as labor costs and material costs and it is deducted from the total revenue to calculate profit. However, it doesn’t include a company’s overhead costs including employee salaries or advertising expenses, for example. It often appears as a second line item on a company’s income statement, after the sales revenue. Gross profit margin is calculated by subtracting net sales from the COGS (which equals the gross margin) and dividing that figure by the net sales. Here’s how to calculate the gross profit margin: It’s represented as a percentage of net income remaining as profit after accounting for the COGS. Unlike net profit margin, gross profit margin is helpful in determining how much profit is generated from a business’s goods and services since it does not include overhead costs whereas net profit margin does. Pros and Cons of Net Profit Margin Pros Cons May help with understanding whether the current business strategy is working. Does not focus on sales revenue from a business’s goods and services. Can be used to effectively measure and compare the profitability between two companies. Pros and Cons of Gross Profit Margin Pros Cons Can help determine how much profit is generated directly from a business’s goods and services. Does not include a business’s total overhead costs in its calculation, such as employee salaries or advertising costs. May help identify areas of improvement in business strategy. How Does Net Profit Margin Differ from Gross Profit Margin? Net profit margin includes all expenses like employee salaries, debt payments, and taxes whereas gross profit margin identifies how much revenue is directly generated from a business’s goods and services but excludes overhead costs. Net profit margin may be considered a more holistic overview of a company’s profitability. Why Should Investors Consider a Company’s Net Profit Margin? Investors should consider a company’s net profit margin because it’s a key indicator of a company’s profitability and whether investing in it is a wise decision. If a business shows increasing profits and decreased expenses over time, this may make it more worthwhile and profitable to potential investors. How Can a Company Positively Impact Its Net Profit Margin? A company can positively impact its net profit margin by increasing its revenue, whether through price increases or an increased sale volume, while simultaneously eliminating unnecessary expenses and increasing efficiencies. However, it’s important to recognize that cutting expenses may negatively impact profits if the cuts are too dramatic. For example, if a company lays off half its staff to save on salary costs, it may be more difficult to drive company profits with fewer workers. Alternatively, if a company finds cheaper supplies for its materials, perhaps that may result in producing a lower quality product which, in turn, could decrease sales. The Bottom Line The net profit margin indicates a business’s profits as a percentage of total revenue. In addition to other measures, the net margin is a key indicator of a company’s profitability and can be used to determine whether a business’s strategy is working or whether changes to increase profitability are needed. For investors, a healthy and stable net profit margin is a positive sign of financial strength and operational efficiency.",
    "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossmargin.asp": "Definition Gross margin is the percentage of money a company keeps from its sales after covering the direct costs of producing its goods or services. It shows how efficiently a business turns revenue into profit before accounting for overhead and other expenses. What Is Gross Margin? Gross margin is the percentage of a company's revenue that's retained after direct expenses such as labor and materials have been subtracted. It's an important profitability measure that looks at a company's gross profit as compared to its revenue. Gross profit is determined by subtracting the cost of goods sold from revenue. The higher the gross margin, the more revenue a company retains. It can then use the revenue to pay other costs or satisfy debt obligations. Key Takeaways Gross margin measures a company's gross profit compared to its revenues as a percentage. A higher gross margin means a company retains more capital. A company may cut labor costs or source cheaper suppliers if its gross margin drops. Gross margin focuses on revenue and COGS, unlike the net profit margin, which takes all of a business's expenses into account. Investopedia / Tara Anand Formula and Calculation of Gross Margin Gross Margin = ( Net sales-COGS Net Sales ) × 100 \\begin{aligned}&\\text{Gross Margin}=\\bigg(\\frac{\\text{Net sales-COGS}}{\\text{Net Sales}}\\bigg)\\times100\\end{aligned} ​ Gross Margin = ( Net Sales Net sales-COGS ​ ) × 100 ​ Net Sales is the equivalent to revenue or the total amount of money generated from sales for the period. It can also be referred to as net sales because it can include discounts and deductions from returned merchandise. Revenue is typically called the top line because it appears at the top of the income statement. Costs are subtracted from revenue to calculate net income or the bottom line. COGS stands for \"cost of goods sold.\" The direct costs associated with producing goods include both direct labor costs and any costs of materials used in producing or manufacturing a company’s products. Imagine that a business collects $200,000 in sales revenue. Let's assume that the cost of goods consists of the $100,000 it spends on manufacturing supplies. The gross profit is, therefore, $100,000 after subtracting its COGS from sales. The gross margin is 50% or ($200,000 - $100,000) ÷ $200,000. What Gross Margin Can Tell You A company's gross margin is the percentage of revenue after COGS. It's calculated by dividing a company's gross profit by its sales. Gross profit is a company's revenue less the cost of goods sold. A company's gross margin is 35% if it retains $0.35 from each dollar of revenue generated. COGS has already been taken into account so those remaining funds can consequently be channeled toward paying debts, general and administrative expenses, interest fees, and dividend distributions to shareholders. Companies use gross margin to measure how their production costs relate to their revenues. A company might strive to slash labor costs or source cheaper suppliers of materials if its gross margin is falling, or it may decide to increase prices as a revenue-increasing measure. Gross profit margins can also be used to measure company efficiency or compare two companies with different market capitalizations. Fast Fact Gross margin may also be referred to as gross profit margin. Gross Margin vs. Net Margin Gross margin focuses solely on the relationship between revenue and COGS, but net margin or net profit margin is a little different. A company's net margin takes all of a business's expenses into account. It's the percentage of net income earned from revenues received. Businesses subtract their COGS as well as ancillary expenses when calculating net margin and related margins. Some of these expenses include product distribution, sales representative wages, miscellaneous operating expenses , and taxes. Gross margin helps a company assess the profitability of its manufacturing activities. Net profit margin helps the company assess its overall profitability. Companies and investors can determine whether the operating costs and overhead are in check and whether enough profit is generated from sales. Gross Margin vs. Gross Profit Gross margin and gross profit are among the metrics that companies can use to measure their profitability. Both of these figures can be found on corporate financial statements and specifically on a company's income statement. They're commonly used interchangeably, but these two figures are different. Gross margin is a profitability measure that's expressed as a percentage. Gross profit is expressed as a dollar figure. Gross profit can be calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold from a company's revenue. It sheds light on how much money a company earns after factoring in production and sales costs. How Do You Calculate Gross Margin? Gross margin is expressed as a percentage. First, subtract the cost of goods sold from the company's revenue. This figure is the company's gross profit expressed as a dollar figure. Divide that figure by the total revenue and multiply it by 100 to get the gross margin. What's the Difference Between Gross Margin and Gross Profit? The terms gross margin and gross profit are often used interchangeably, but they're two separate metrics that companies use to measure and express their profitability. Both factor in a company's revenue and the cost of goods sold, but they're a little different. Gross profit is revenue less the cost of goods sold and is expressed as a dollar figure. A company's gross margin is the gross profit compared to its sales and is expressed as a percentage. What Is a Good Gross Margin? The gross margin varies by industry. Service-based industries tend to have higher gross margins and gross profit margins because they don't have large amounts of COGS. The gross margin for manufacturing companies will be lower because they have larger COGS. The Bottom Line Different metrics can be used to measure a company's profitability. Gross margin is just one of these figures. Gross margin may also be called gross profit margin. It looks at a company's gross profit compared to its revenue or sales and is expressed as a percentage. This figure can help companies understand whether there are any inefficiencies and if cuts are required to address them and increase profits. The gross margin is also a way for investors to determine whether a company is a good investment."
